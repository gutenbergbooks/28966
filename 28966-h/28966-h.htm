<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="desc">COUSIN BEN</p>


<p>Edna and Cousin Ben Barker were on
the back porch. It was a favorite place,
for it was always shady there in summer
and out of the wind on cold days. If big
Cousin Ben did not always like to be
where Edna was, on the other hand Edna
invariably sought out Cousin Ben if he
were to be found about the premises.</p>

<p>On this special afternoon he was doing
something to his wheel, getting it in order
for a long ride which he had planned for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>the next day. Edna stood watching him,
ready to hand a tool or run for a piece of
rag to be used in cleaning, or to fill the oil
can from the bottle on the shelf upstairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to-day, Cousin
Ben?&rdquo; Edna always asked this for
Cousin Ben&rsquo;s replies were generally so
funny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the woods,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
see Johnny-jump-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why will he jump up?&rdquo; asked Edna
in pleased expectancy of something amusing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the dog-wood bark, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know dog-wood blossoms,&rdquo; returned
Edna a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, and I dare say you know
the dog-wood bark, too, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es, I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cousin Ben went on burnishing the
metal he was at work upon. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>he continued after a moment, &ldquo;the catkins
will all be out and when I meet one
I shall say, &lsquo;Pussy, will oh, will you tell
me the way to the elder Berries.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose she will say?&rdquo;
inquired Edna settling herself well content
to continue this sort of talk, though
thinking it was scarcely the season for
Pussy-willows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will say: &lsquo;The elder Berry?
My dear boy, any dog ought to know the
way there.&rsquo; You see she knows I am a
Barker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna laughed. &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will say, &lsquo;Yes, madam, but that
sassy Fras always tries to get in my path.
It is a very easy matter to whip poor Will,
but sassy Fras is another matter.&rsquo; Then
she will ask: &lsquo;Did you ever try to haze
L. Nutt?&rsquo; and I will reply, &lsquo;Chestnuts!&rsquo;
for I don&rsquo;t like to talk about hazing, being
in a position to expect a little of it any
day. Well, Ande, I must be off or I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
find Pip&rsquo;s sis away.&rdquo; Cousin Ben always
called Edna Ande because he declared
that was what her name really was but
had been turned hind side before. Some
persons, Edna&rsquo;s sister Celia and Agnes
Evans, for instance, called Cousin Ben a
very silly boy, but Edna thought his kind
of nonsense great fun.</p>

<p>It was an afternoon in autumn. For
some time past, Edna and her sister had
been going into the city to school every
day, but this was the last week when this
would be done, for after this they would
go only on Mondays returning on Fridays
till the days became long again.
During the winter when it was still dark
at seven in the morning, and when the
afternoons were so short, it had seemed
better that they should not come home
every day. Therefore, as Aunt Elizabeth
Horner and Uncle Justus wanted much
to have them remain, it was so arranged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Edna was a great favorite with her Uncle
Justus, for she had spent the winter previous
at his house and had gone to his
school. Then, on account of Mr. Conway&rsquo;s
business, the family had removed
from the town in which they had formerly
lived and had taken a house a little out
of the city.</p>

<p>Like most children Edna loved the
country and was glad of the change. A
little further up the road lived her friend
Dorothy Evans and her sister Agnes, the
latter was a little older than Edna&rsquo;s sister
Celia. All four girls attended Uncle
Justus&rsquo; school and so did Margaret MacDonald,
the adopted daughter of good
Mrs. MacDonald who lived in the big gray
stone house with the lovely grounds.
Margaret was having a pretty hard time
of it, as she had never had much opportunity
of going to school and was far behind
the girls of her own age. Edna and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Dorothy were her staunch defenders,
however and when matters came to a too
difficult pass the older girls were appealed
to and could always straighten out whatever
was wrong. Frank and Charlie,
Edna&rsquo;s brothers, were almost too large
for Uncle Justus&rsquo; school, where only little
fellows went, so they went elsewhere to
the school which Roger and Steve Porter
attended. It was Cousin Ben&rsquo;s first year
at college, and he was housed at the Conways,
his mother being an elder sister of
Edna&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<p>After seeing Cousin Ben start off, Edna
left the porch and stood for a moment
thinking what she would do next. This
being the last time she would be at home
for the entire week, she concluded she
ought to make the most of it, but first she
must get together such things as she
should want for Monday. &ldquo;Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday afternoons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and Monday, too. There are only four,
after all,&rdquo; she said, counting the days on
her fingers. &ldquo;It seems very much longer
when you first think of it.&rdquo; And then, as
she continued to think, to her surprise she
discovered that only Tuesdays, Wednesdays
and Thursdays would be the entire
days she would spend away from
home.</p>

<p>She was so interested in having found
this out that she ran upstairs to her
mother, to tell of it. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I have made a discovery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have, and what is it?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Conway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here I&rsquo;ve been thinking I&rsquo;d be
away from you the whole week all but Saturday
and Sunday, and now I find out I
shall see you every day but three, &rsquo;cause,
you know, I don&rsquo;t start till after breakfast
on Monday, so that&rsquo;s one day. Then
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t see you, but I get back in time for
dinner on Friday, so there is Friday, Saturday
and Sunday, three more days.
Isn&rsquo;t it fine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the funny part is,&rdquo; Edna went on
busily thinking, &ldquo;I am at school five days
out of the seven. It&rsquo;s almost like a
puzzle, isn&rsquo;t it? I think I shall take Ada
with me and leave her there. She is used
to it, and won&rsquo;t mind as much as some of
the other dolls, for she was there all last
year and besides, Aunt Elizabeth gave her
to me. Aunt Elizabeth is quite kind
sometimes, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She means to be kind all the time, but
she has rather a stern manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you used to be afraid of her when
you were a little girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, honey, because I didn&rsquo;t know her.
She is your papa&rsquo;s aunt, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he told me he didn&rsquo;t see much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
her, for he lived in quite another place,
and I suppose by the time he grew up he
wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anybody. Well, anyhow,
I&rsquo;m glad it won&rsquo;t be &lsquo;butter or molasses&rsquo;
all the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, dearie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know we couldn&rsquo;t have both
and there were never any preserves.
Sometimes there were stewed apples, the
dried kind, and they were not so very bad
when they were sweet enough and had a
lot of lemon flavor in them. I used to ask
Ellen to do them that way and she always
would, except when Aunt Elizabeth was in
the kitchen and then she had to do as
Aunt Elizabeth told her. If you have
more preserves than you can use, don&rsquo;t
you think you could send her some,
mother? You see we shall not be here to
eat them, Celia and I, and you won&rsquo;t have
to use so many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an idea. Why, yes, I can send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
some in every week when you go, and Celia
can tell Aunt Elizabeth to have them
for your supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will she tell her?&rdquo; asked Edna,
feeling that this was an ordeal that she
would not like to go through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it will be very easy to say,
&lsquo;Aunt Elizabeth, here are some preserves
mother thought would be nice for supper
to-night.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you think that would
be easy to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; returned Edna a little doubtful
if this would have the proper effect.
&ldquo;I think myself it would be better to let
Ellen have them or Uncle Justus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother laughed. Edna&rsquo;s awe of
Aunt Elizabeth was so very apparent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I wish you would
promise,&rdquo; the little girl went on, &ldquo;and
that is, that you will always have hot
cakes on Saturday mornings so I can have
butter and syrup both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; replied her mother smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know Louis is mighty glad not to be
going back,&rdquo; Edna continued, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
rather glad he isn&rsquo;t myself, for this year
I shall have Celia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were fond of Louis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am pretty fond of him, but I&rsquo;d
rather have girls about all the time than
boys all the time. Girls fuss with you, of
course. They get mad and won&rsquo;t speak,
but I&rsquo;d liefer they&rsquo;d do that than try to
boss you the way boys do. Mother, there
is another thing I wish you would do, and
that is I wish you would tell Aunt Elizabeth
that she will please let Dorothy come
to play with me sometimes. Dorothy is
my particular friend, you know, and Aunt
Elizabeth will never allow me to have her
visit me unless you say she can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she never allow you to have company
last winter?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna shook her head and a sigh escaped
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will arrange that Dorothy shall
come,&rdquo; said her mother quite firmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be much nicer than last
year,&rdquo; remarked Edna in a satisfied tone,
&ldquo;for I shall always have Celia to go to,
and you will be so near, too, and besides I
like Uncle Justus much better than I did
at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the two I should think you would
have more fear of Uncle Justus than
of Aunt Elizabeth,&rdquo; said her mother looking
down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did at first, but I found it was
mostly on account of his eyebrows; they
are so shaggy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway smiled. &ldquo;I have heard it
said that he can be rather terrible,&rdquo; she
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, so he can, but he isn&rsquo;t all the
time and Aunt Elizabeth is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope this year you will find out that
it is only Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s eyebrows,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be, for she hasn&rsquo;t any to
speak of,&rdquo; returned Edna. As she talked
she was carefully packing the little trunk
in which Ada&rsquo;s clothes were kept. It was
a tiny trunk, only about six inches long.
Aunt Elizabeth had made it, herself, by
covering a box with leather and strapping
the leather across with strips of wood
glued on. Edna liked the trunk much
better than a larger one which had been
bought at the store. Aunt Elizabeth was
very clever in making things of this kind
and would sometimes surprise her little
niece with some home-made gift which
was the more prized because it was unusual.
The child remembered this now
and began to feel that she had not
shown herself very grateful in speaking
as she had done a moment before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that
Aunt Elizabeth was frightful all the time.
She is very kind when she gives me things
like this trunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean frightful,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Conway laughing, &ldquo;you mean she is
rather formidable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that was too much of a word for
Edna, though she did not say so. Having
stowed away Ada&rsquo;s belongings, three
frocks, two petticoats, a red hood and
sacque, a blue dressing-gown and apron,
she shut the lid. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll take
her furs this week because she&rsquo;ll not need
them,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think
I will take any of my other dolls because
I will be so glad to see them next Friday.
Mother, if you come into town any time
during the week will you come out to see
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have time I certainly shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna gave a sigh of content. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
surely going to be much better than last
year. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, changing the
subject, &ldquo;do you think Cousin Ben is
silly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can be rather silly but he can also
be very sensible. He is silly only when he
wants to tease or when he wants to amuse
a little girl I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like his silly better than some of the
big girls&rsquo;s sillies. They giggle so much
and aren&rsquo;t funny at all. I think he is
very funny. He says such queer things
about the trees and plants in the woods.
He twists their names around so they
mean something else. Like the dog-wood,
bark, you know. Mother, what is hazing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the kind of thing the college boys
do to those in a lower class; they play
tricks on them which sometimes are really
very cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean they really hurt them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they hurt them very much.
I knew of one young man who was forced
into a pond of water on an icy day in the
fall, and who nearly died of pneumonia
in consequence of the cold he took from
having to be in his wet clothes so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will do anything
like that to Cousin Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope not, though no doubt
there will be some tricks played on him
as he is a Freshman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna knew what a Freshman was but
the matter of hazing was quite new to her
and troubled her very much. Cousin
Ben had gone out alone to the woods.
Perhaps this very moment someone was
lying in wait for him.</p>

<p>Hastily setting away the doll and trunk
she ran downstairs, put on her coat and
hat and started up the road toward the
woods nearest. She had no exact plan in
her mind, but she knew Cousin Ben had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
probably gone to see one of his classmates
who lived just beyond this piece of woods.
The college was on the outskirts of the
city and the dormitories were within easy
walking distance, so that one was liable
to see a group of college boys at almost
any time. Edna trotted along hoping to
overtake her cousin. She did not believe
anyone would attack him unless he were
alone, and she meant to keep him company
on his return walk. Just as she reached
the edge of the woods she came upon a
group of Sophomores standing a short
distance away and she heard one say.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll nab him as he comes out, boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who could they mean but Cousin Ben?
She walked slowly that she might, if possible,
hear more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he came this way?&rdquo; she
heard another say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;We saw him
go in Abercrombie&rsquo;s gate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>That settled it in Edna&rsquo;s mind, for it
was Will Abercrombie whose house
Cousin Ben most frequented. She hesitated
a moment, wondering what path
her cousin would take, and then she remembered
that the short cut was through
the woods; it was much longer by the
road. It was already getting rather late
and it looked grim and gloomy in the
woods, but there was nothing to do but
face any danger and go straight ahead.
She was crafty enough not to turn in at
once for fear the boys might suspect, so
she kept on a short distance to where the
road turned and then she cut into the bit
of forest scrambling up the bank and
scratching her hands, with the brambles,
but reaching the path in a few minutes.
The further she went the darker it grew.
The sun was setting and she could see long
fingers of light between the trees. She
wished she had some one with her, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Cousin Ben would appear before she went
much further, but there was no sign of
him and she plodded on, the dead leaves
rustling about her feet or falling from
overhead, giving her little starts of fear.
It seemed a long, long way, and she almost
wished she had not undertaken the
work of rescue, but at last she saw, dimly
ahead of her, a figure approaching and
heard a cheerful whistling which she recognized
as her cousin&rsquo;s. And she darted
forward to meet him.</p>

<p class="desc">THE SECRET</p>


<p>Cousin Ben striding along did not at
first see the little girl, but at her calling
&ldquo;Cousin Ben, Cousin Ben,&rdquo; he stopped
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you little monkey, what are you
doing here?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The bugaboos
will catch you here in these dark woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t such a thing as bugaboos,&rdquo;
returned Edna stoutly, &ldquo;and I should be
very silly to think so, but something will
catch you if you don&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The gob-e-lins will get you if you
don&rsquo;t look out,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Cousin Ben,
laughing. &ldquo;Is that what you are trying
to say? If you are not afraid of bugaboos
neither am I afraid of goblins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
What do you think is going to get a big
fellow like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Edna at once becoming
serious, &ldquo;I will tell you; I heard some
college boys talking back there by the edge
of the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did? and what did they say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They said: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll nab him as he
comes out, boys.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! What did they look like?
Did you know any of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one who said that was John Fielding,
and there was another that I&rsquo;ve seen
before. He sits back of our pew at
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophs, both of them, and did you come
all this way to tell me about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I was afraid they wanted
to haze you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you know about hazing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother told me about a young man
who nearly died of pneumonia because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
some of the boys doused him in cold water,
in a pond or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t want me to have pneumonia.
I won&rsquo;t on this occasion, I promise
you. I think we can circumnavigate
those fellows. I won&rsquo;t see Johnny-jump-up
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna laughed. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they be disappointed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will that. Now come along and
let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way shall we go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will take the back road and
come out there below the MacDonald barn
so they won&rsquo;t get a hint of our coming
home, for the barn is below the woods,
you know. It is a little further, but I
hope you don&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I am so glad to have you
get out of the way of those boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can manage to side-track them
for a while perhaps they won&rsquo;t be so keen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I thought they had it in for me, and have
been rather expecting an onslaught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They cut through the woods, coming out
the other side and taking a short road not
much used, which brought them out a little
distance from the main road which
was then easily reached. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re
safe,&rdquo; said Edna with satisfaction as she
saw her own gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We? You don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;d haze
<a name="tn23" id="tn23"></a>you, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has ' do you?&rsquo; '">do you?&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, but I feel safer when I am
near home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben dropped his bantering tone when
they came up to the gate. &ldquo;I say, Edna,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you are a real Trojan to do this
for me, and I shall not forget it in a
hurry. Lots of big girls and boys, too,
would have let the thing go, and not have
taken the trouble. I am a thousand times
obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I wanted to do it, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I should have been very unhappy if anything
had happened to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you would,&rdquo; returned Ben
seriously; and they went in the house
together.</p>

<p>This was the last Edna heard of hazing
and if Cousin Ben was ever caught he
did not tell her or anyone else.</p>

<p>Monday came around quite soon enough
and Edna started off with her sister Celia
to go to the city. It seemed quite
natural to be back in the room which she
had occupied the year before, only now
Celia would share it with her. Ada was
put in her old place on a little chair, her
trunk by her side, and then the two girls
went down to the school-room where a
number of the pupils had already gathered.
One of these was Clara Adams, a
little girl whom Edna was sorry to see
entering the school that year. She was
a spoiled, discontented child who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
continually pouting over some fancied
grievance, and was what Dorothy and
Edna called &ldquo;fusty.&rdquo; For some reason
she was always trying to pick a quarrel
with Edna, and by the whispering which
went on when Edna entered the room and
the sidelong looks which were cast at her,
as two or three girls, with hands to
mouths, nudged one another, she felt sure
that on this special occasion she was being
talked about. However, she paid no
attention to this little group but went
over to where Dorothy was sitting and began
to tell her about the preserves which
Celia had successfully given in Ellen&rsquo;s
charge.</p>

<p>At recess the same group of girls which
had been whispering in the morning,
again gathered in one corner and began
their talk in low tones. Clara Adams
was in the centre and it was she to whom
the others were all looking. Clara was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
favorite because of her wealth rather than
because of her disposition, and she had
followers who liked to have it said that
they were intimate with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose they are talking
about?&rdquo; said Dorothy after a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know and what&rsquo;s
more I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; replied Edna. &ldquo;Do
you care, Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; just a little, I think.
See, they are going over and whispering
to Molly Clark, and she is getting up and
going over there. I wonder what it is all
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna wondered, too, but neither she nor
Dorothy found out that day. The same
thing went on the next day. One by one
most of the girls whom Edna and Dorothy
liked the best were seen to join the little
company of whisperers, and whenever
Clara Adams would pass the two friends
she would give them a look as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<a name="tn27" id="tn27"></a><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'to say. Wouldn&rsquo;t'">to say: Wouldn&rsquo;t</ins> you like to know what
we know?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is just horrid mean of
them,&rdquo; said Dorothy when the next day
came and they were no nearer to knowing
the secret than they had been in the beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard Molly say something about to-morrow
afternoon,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;They
are all going to do something or go somewhere.
I am going to tell sister, so I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell my sister. Maybe they
know something about it, Edna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They lost no time in seeking out their
sisters to whom they made known the
state of affairs. &ldquo;And they are getting
hold of nearly all the nicest girls,&rdquo; complained
Edna. &ldquo;Molly Clark, and Ruth
Cutting and all those. They haven&rsquo;t said
anything to Margaret, for I asked her.
She isn&rsquo;t here to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea what they are going
to do?&rdquo; Dorothy asked her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have an idea, but it may not be
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell us, do.&rdquo; The two younger
girls were very eager.</p>

<p>Agnes leaned over and said in a low
voice, &ldquo;I believe they are getting up some
sort of club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; This idea had never occurred
to either of the little girls before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t want us in it,&rdquo; said
Edna, &ldquo;I wonder why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all that horrid Clara Adams,&rdquo; declared
Dorothy. &ldquo;She is jealous of you
because you always know your lessons and
behave yourself, and she don&rsquo;t like me because
I go with you and won&rsquo;t give you
up for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; returned Dorothy, and then
she shut her lips very tightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All the girls used to like us,&rdquo; said
Edna sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your dear heart,&rdquo; said Agnes
drawing the child to her, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t care.
They will be sorry enough after a while,
you may be sure, and will wish they had
treated you two better. Celia, we mustn&rsquo;t
let those little whippersnappers have it all
their own way. Never you mind, children,
we&rsquo;ll do something, too. Celia and
I will talk it over and let you know to-morrow.
You and Celia come up to our
house Saturday afternoon and we&rsquo;ll see
if we can get Margaret and perhaps one
or two others. Now run along and let us
talk over a plan I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two went off joyously, arms around
one another. When Agnes championed
their cause there was no more reason to
be troubled, and they finished their recess
in a corner by themselves quite content.</p>

<p>There were not more than a dozen little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
girls in the class and when half of these
had gone over to the enemy, and one or
two were absent it left a very small number
for Edna and Dorothy to count upon,
but they did not care after the older girls
had taken up their cause, and they cast
quite as independent looks at Clara as
she did at them. They would have a
secret too. &ldquo;And it will be a great deal
nicer than theirs,&rdquo; declared Dorothy.
So when the bell rang they went back
to their seats in a very happy frame of
mind.</p>

<p>The next day a new pupil appeared and
at recess she was swooped down upon by
one of Clara&rsquo;s friends and was borne
away, but after a while she left the group
and went back to her seat. Dorothy and
Edna were out in the school yard playing,
but when they came in the new scholar
looked smilingly at Edna and after a
while she made her way to where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
were standing. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this Edna Conway?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Edna,&rdquo; was the reply from
the little round-faced girl who smiled at
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jennie Ramsey, and my mother
told me to be sure to speak to you and tell
you I was at the fair last year and I
was so glad when you got the doll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, were you there?&rdquo; Edna looked
pleased. &ldquo;I am so glad you have come
here to school. This is Dorothy Evans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jennie and Dorothy smiled at each
other and Edna went on. &ldquo;Dorothy
don&rsquo;t you remember about Mrs. Ramsey
who took so much trouble to get Margaret
away from that dreadful woman? She
must be a lovely mother, for she was so
dear to Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do tell me about her,&rdquo; said Jennie.
&ldquo;I have been so much interested, for
mother told me all about how you ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
against her in the street and how you won
the doll for her and all about her being
adopted so I did hope I should know you
some day. I&rsquo;d like to be friends, if you
will let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to be,&rdquo; Edna spoke
heartily, &ldquo;and I am so glad you know
about Margaret. She comes here to
school, but of course she isn&rsquo;t very happy
about having to be in the class with such
little girls. Mrs. MacDonald is talking
of getting a governess for her till she can
catch up a little, but we shall be sorry to
have her not come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Clara Adams?&rdquo; Dorothy
asked. &ldquo;I mean did you know her
before you came to school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know her. She is in my Sunday-school
class,&rdquo; returned Jennie, but
she said nothing more, yet both the other
two felt quite sure that there was no likelihood
of Jennie&rsquo;s going over to the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
faction. Then the bell rang and they all
took their seats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like her?&rdquo; whispered Edna
before Miss Ashurst had taken her
place.</p>

<p>Dorothy nodded yes, and glanced across
at Clara who curled her lip scornfully.</p>

<p>When school was dismissed Jennie and
Dorothy walked home together. Agnes
and Dorothy remained in the city during
the week just as the two Conway sisters
had begun to do. Edna sought her sister
Celia after dinner when the two had their
study hour. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it nice,&rdquo; said Edna,
&ldquo;Jennie Ramsey has come to school, and
she is such a nice little girl. I heard Uncle
Justus say once that Mrs. Ramsey was
much wealthier than Mrs. Adams but that
one never saw her making any pretence
because of her money. What is pretence,
sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is pretending, I suppose. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
he meant she didn&rsquo;t put on airs because
of having money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna nodded. She quite understood.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it lovely for Jennie to want to
be friends? She said her mother told her
to be sure to speak to me, and, oh, sister,
we saw one of the other girls go over and
try to get her to join Clara&rsquo;s set and she
didn&rsquo;t <a name="tn34" id="tn34"></a>stay but came over <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'to us.&rdquo; She'">to us. She</ins>
said she knew Clara but I don&rsquo;t believe
she likes her. Did you and Agnes talk
about, you know what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;ll tell you but you mustn&rsquo;t
ask me any questions now for I shall not
answer. Now let us get to work or Aunt
Elizabeth will be down on us for talking
in study hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna turned her attention to her books
and in a moment was not thinking of
anything but her geography.</p>

<p>She could scarcely wait till the next
day, however, when she and Dorothy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
should learn what Agnes had planned, but
alas, she was not allowed this pleasure
for Aunt Elizabeth called her from the
school-room just at recess and took her
down to see Miss Martin, the daughter of
the rector of the church. Of course
Edna was very glad to see Miss Martin,
for she was very fond of her, but she did
wish she had chosen some other day to
call, and not only was Edna required to
remain down in the parlor during the
whole of recess but she was again summoned
before she had a chance to speak a
word to anyone at the close of school.
This time it was to run an errand to the
shop where an order had been forgotten
and Edna was despatched to bring home
the required article, Ellen being too busy
to be spared.</p>

<p>She felt rather out of sorts at having
both of her opportunities taken from her.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they couldn&rsquo;t have sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
sister,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;or why they
couldn&rsquo;t do without rice for just this once.
I should think something else would be
better, anyway, for dessert than rice and
sugar.&rdquo; But there was no arranging
Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s affairs for her and when
the dish of rice appeared Edna was
obliged to eat it in place of any other
dessert. Her ill humor passed away,
however, when Uncle Justus looked at her
from under his shaggy brows and asked
her if she didn&rsquo;t want to go to Captain
Doane&rsquo;s with him. This was a place
which always delighted her, for Captain
Doane had been all over the world and
had brought back with him all sorts of
curiosities. Moreover, there was always
a supply of preserved ginger taken from
a queer jar with twisted handles, and
there was also an especially toothsome
cake which the captain&rsquo;s housekeeper
served, so Edna felt that the feast in store<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for her, quite made up for the poverty of
a dessert of boiled rice and sugar.</p>

<p>She wondered that Celia was not also
asked to go, but she remembered that
Celia did not know Captain Doane, and
that probably she would think it very
stupid to play with shells and other queer
things while two old gentlemen talked on
politics or some such dry subject. Therefore
she went off very happily, rather
glad that after all there was a pleasure
for this day and one in prospect for the
morrow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="desc">A SATURDAY AFTERNOON</p>


<p>By Friday, Jennie, Dorothy and Edna
had become quite intimate. Margaret
was still kept at home by a bad cold, so
these three little girls played at recess
together joined by one or two others who
had not been invited, or had not chosen,
to belong to what the rest called &ldquo;Clara
Adams&rsquo;s set.&rdquo; There had been a most interesting
talk with Agnes and Celia and
a plan was proposed which was to be
started on Saturday afternoon. Jennie
had been invited to come, and was to go
home with Dorothy after school to be sent
for later.</p>

<p>Edna was full of the new scheme when
she reached home on Friday, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
no sooner in the house than she rushed up
stairs to her mother. &ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;I am so glad to see you, and I have
so much to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then come right in and tell it,&rdquo; said
her mother kissing her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look
as if you had starved on bread and molasses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna laughed. &ldquo;Nor on rice. I hope
you will never have rice on Saturdays,
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rice is a most wholesome and excellent
dish,&rdquo; returned her mother. &ldquo;See
how the Chinese thrive on it. I am thinking
it would be the very best thing I could
give my family, for it is both nourishing
and cheap. Suppose you go down and
tell Maria to have a large dishful for
supper instead of what I have ordered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna knew her mother was teasing, so
she cuddled up to her and asked: &ldquo;What
did you order, mother?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should you say to waffles and
chicken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, delicious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is that great thing you
were going to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot. Well, when we got to
school last Monday, there was Clara
Adams and all the girls she could get together
and they were whispering in a
corner. They looked over at me and I
knew they were talking about me, but I
didn&rsquo;t care. Then I went over to Dorothy
and we just stayed by ourselves all
the time, for those other girls didn&rsquo;t
seem to want to have anything to do with
us. We hadn&rsquo;t done one single thing to
make them act so, but Clara Adams is so
hateful and jealous and all that, she
couldn&rsquo;t bear to have us be liked by anybody.
Dorothy told me she heard her say
I was a pet and that was the reason I got
along with my lessons. You know I study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
real hard, mother, and it isn&rsquo;t that at all.
Clara said it was just because Uncle
Justus favored me, and told Miss Ashurst
too. Wasn&rsquo;t that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was rather mean, but you
must not mind what a spoiled child like
Clara says, as long as you know it isn&rsquo;t
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Agnes says. We told
Agnes and Celia how the girls were doing
and how they had a secret and didn&rsquo;t
want us to be in it, so Agnes said we could
have a secret, too, and she has planned a
beautiful one, she and Celia. I will tell
you about it presently. Well, then Jennie
Ramsey came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jennie Ramsey? I don&rsquo;t think I ever
heard you speak of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course you didn&rsquo;t, for I
only just became acquainted with her.
Mother, don&rsquo;t you remember the lovely
Mrs. Ramsey that did so much about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
getting Margaret into the Home of the
Friendless?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she is Jennie&rsquo;s mother, and she
told Jennie to be sure to speak to me, because
she knows Aunt Elizabeth, I suppose,
but anyhow, she did. But first the
Clara Adams set tried to get Jennie to go
with them, but she just wouldn&rsquo;t, and so
she&rsquo;s on our side. I know Clara is furious
because the Ramseys are richer than
the Adamses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Conway interrupted,
&ldquo;this doesn&rsquo;t sound a bit like
my little girl talking about one person
being richer than another and about
one little girl&rsquo;s being furious about
another&rsquo;s making friends with whom she
chooses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna was silent for a moment.
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;it is all
Clara Adams&rsquo;s doings. If she wouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
speak to us nor let the other girls play
with us, why, what could we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know, my darling, we&rsquo;ll
talk of that directly. Go on with your
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so Agnes found out they were
getting up a club and didn&rsquo;t want us in
it, so she said we could have a club, too,
and we&rsquo;re going to begin this afternoon&mdash;no,
to-morrow afternoon. Mrs. Ramsey
let Jennie go home with Dorothy to stay
till to-morrow and she is going to send the
automobile for her. She comes to school
in the automobile every morning. I wish
we had one then we wouldn&rsquo;t have to stay
in town all the week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear blessed child, I am afraid Clara
Adams is turning your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara? why she doesn&rsquo;t even speak to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same you are beginning to care
more for the things that are important to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
her than ever you did before. Never
mind, we&rsquo;ll talk about that later. Is that
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about all, for we haven&rsquo;t had the
club meeting yet. Agnes says she will
start it and be the president for a month.
Celia is going to be the secretary and
when we know just what to do and how
to carry it on then they will resign and
some of us younger girls will be the officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Conway smiled to hear all this
grown-up talk, but she looked a little serious
a moment after.</p>

<p>Edna watched her face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
approve of it, mamma,&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the club? Oh, yes, if it is the right
kind of one. I will ask Celia about it,
but what I don&rsquo;t like is that you should
start it in a spirit of trying to get the
better of another girl, though I can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that it is the most natural thing in the
world for you to feel as you do, and I can
see that Clara has really brought it on
herself, but I do want my dear little girls
to be charitable and above the petty meanness
that is actuating Clara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what do you think we ought to
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure. I shall have to think
it over. In the meantime by all means
start your club. Where is Celia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She went out with the boys to look
at the new pigeons, but I wanted to see
you first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna enjoyed the prospect of chicken
and waffles too much to long too ardently
for the next day. She hadn&rsquo;t seen Cousin
Ben yet so she went out to hunt him up,
but discovering that he was hard at work
over his studies she concluded not to disturb
him but to go with the boys to hear
them expatiate upon the qualities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
new pigeons, of the trade they had made
with another boy and of various things
which had been going on at their school.</p>

<p>Great preparations were made for the
first meeting of the club. In the Evans
house was a large attic, one corner of
which Agnes and Celia turned into a
club-room. The house was an old-fashioned
one, and the attic window was
small. There was, too, an odor of camphor
and of soap, a quantity of the latter
being stored up there, but these things did
not in the least detract from the place in
the eyes of the girls. What they wanted
was mystery, a place which was out of the
way, and one specially set aside for their
meetings. A small table was dragged out
of the recesses of the attic. It was rather
wobbly, but a bit of wood was put under
the faulty leg, and it did very well. One
perfectly good chair was brought up for
the president, the rest were content to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
seated on whatever came handy, two
chairs very much gone as to backs, one
with the bottom entirely through, and a
rickety camp stool made up the remainder
of the furniture, but Agnes had taken
care that there were flowers on the table
and that pens, pencils and paper were
supplied. She also brought up some
books &ldquo;to make it look more literary,&rdquo;
she said, and the organizers of the club
were delighted.</p>

<p>They came whispering and with suppressed
giggles up the steep stairway,
made their way between piles of trunks
and boxes to where Agnes sat in state, a
call-bell before her. Margaret, much
bundled up, had been permitted to join
them, so they were the respectable number
of six.</p>

<p>That morning the president and secretary
had been closeted for an hour with
Mrs. Conway and whatever they had de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>termined
upon in the beginning which
seemed in the least unworthy was smitten
from the plan.</p>

<p>The girls disposed themselves upon the
various seats, Celia taking a place at the
end of the table provided for the officers.
There was much stifling of laughter and
suppressed whispers before Agnes tapped
the bell and said in the most dignified
manner, &ldquo;The meeting is called to
order.&rdquo; Then each girl smoothed down
her frock and sat up very straight waiting
to hear what should come next.
&ldquo;The real object of our club,&rdquo; Agnes began,
&ldquo;is to find ways of being kind to our
schoolmates, but we are going to do other
things to entertain ourselves, things like
bringing new games into the club and any
new book we find particularly interesting.
If anyone can write a story she is to do
that, and if anyone hears anything particularly
interesting to tell she is to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
it up for the meeting. It has been proposed
by Mrs. Conway that we call the
club the Kindly Club or the Golden Rule.
Celia, we&rsquo;d better take a vote on the
name. You might hand around some
slips of paper and let the members write
their choice. There is one thing about it;
if we call it the Golden Rule Club, we can
always refer to it as the G. R., and that
will be rather nice, I think. However,
you all must vote as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were not quite enough pencils,
but by judicious borrowing they made
out and the slips were handed in and
gravely counted by Celia. &ldquo;There are
four votes for Golden Rule, and two for
Kindly,&rdquo; she announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it is a majority for Golden Rule,
so the name of the club is the Golden
Rule Club, or the G. R., whichever you
choose to say when you are speaking of
it. Now, let me see, oh, yes. We are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
charter members. We haven&rsquo;t any
charter but we can have one, I reckon.
I&rsquo;ll get one ready for next time. Now,
we must have rules. I haven&rsquo;t thought
them all out, but I have two or three.
We begin with the Golden Rule: &lsquo;Do
unto others as ye would they should do
unto you&rsquo;; Mrs. Conway said we might
head the list with that, for there was
nothing better. Of course we all forget
sometimes, but we mustn&rsquo;t any more than
we can help. If we see a chance to do a
kindness to any of our schoolmates we
must do it, no matter if we don&rsquo;t like her,
and we must try not to get mad with any
of the girls. We must be nice to the
teachers, too. You see it is a school club
and affects all in the school. We big
girls mustn&rsquo;t be hateful to you younger
ones and you mustn&rsquo;t be saucy to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed Edna, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going
to be pretty hard, isn&rsquo;t it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it is going to be as
much fun as the other girls&rsquo; club,&rdquo; complained
Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes it is. You wait and see,&rdquo;
said Agnes. &ldquo;After a while everyone of
them will be dying to come into ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Agnes, I don&rsquo;t believe a bit of
that,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you see we are going to have
very good times, you forget that part.
The kind word part is only when we are
having dealings with our schoolmates
and all that. We don&rsquo;t have to do just
that and nothing else. For example, I
have the loveliest sort of story to read to
you all just as soon as the business part
of the meeting is over, and then we are
to have refreshments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; there was emphatic endorsement
of this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ought to be fines, I suppose,&rdquo;
Agnes went on. &ldquo;Let me see, what shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
we be fined for? I shall have to get
some light upon that, too, but I think it
would be a good plan that any girl who
voluntarily stirs up a fuss with another
at school must pay a fine of not less than
one cent. What do you think of that,
Celia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think that might be a good
plan though I expect we shall all turn
Quakers if we continue the club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agnes laughed. &ldquo;It does look that
way. At all events we are to thank Clara
Adams for it all. Her club is founded
on unkindness and if we want to be a
rival, Mrs. Conway says we must have
ours founded on kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about her
club?&rdquo; asked Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know a little. I believe only girls
who live in a certain neighborhood can
belong to it. All others are to be turned
down, and are to be left out of the plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at recess. It is something like that, I was
told. However, we don&rsquo;t care anything
about those poor little sillies. We shall
enjoy ourselves much more. I think
we&rsquo;d better not attend to any business
to-day or we shall not have time for anything
else. Have you made the minutes,
Celia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I have, and if I haven&rsquo;t
everything I can get you to tell me afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we should vote for the
officers,&rdquo; said Agnes, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Edna,
anxious for the story. &ldquo;We all want
you for president and Celia for secretary,
don&rsquo;t we, girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in favor of making Miss Agnes
Evans president of the club will please
rise,&rdquo; sang out Celia, and every girl
arose to her feet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unanimous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
enough,&rdquo; said Celia. &ldquo;Now all in favor
of my being secretary will please rise.&rdquo;
Another unanimous vote followed this
and so the matter was speedily settled.</p>

<p>Then Agnes produced a manuscript
paper and read them the most delightful
of stories which was received with great
applause. Then she whispered something
to Dorothy who nodded understandingly,
retired to the back of the attic and
returned with two plates, one of delicious
little cakes and the other of caramels to
which full justice was done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the places of meeting and
the refreshments?&rdquo; asked Celia. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t fair for you always to furnish them
and don&rsquo;t you think we should meet at
different houses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so, only you see it would be
hard for us to go into the city on Saturdays
after coming out on Friday, and you
see Jennie lives in town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Mack can always bring me
out in the motor car,&rdquo; said Jennie,
&ldquo;though of course I should love to have
you all come in to my house and so would
mamma like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll meet at your house, Celia,
the next time,&rdquo; said <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'Agnes, and after'">Agnes, <a name="tn55" id="tn55"></a>&ldquo;and after</ins>
that at Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s. We can, can&rsquo;t
we, Margaret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am sure she will be perfectly
delighted. She is so pleased about
the club, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then in the meantime we can be
making up our minds about your house,
Jennie,&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had some little song or a
sentence to close with,&rdquo; said Celia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can have. We can do all those
things later. I think we have done a
great deal for one day, don&rsquo;t you all think
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, yes,&rdquo; was the hearty re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>sponse.
&ldquo;It has been perfectly lovely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might sing, &lsquo;Little Drops of
Water,&rsquo; for this time,&rdquo; proposed Edna,
&ldquo;as long as we haven&rsquo;t any special song
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do nicely, especially that
part about &lsquo;little deeds of kindness.&rsquo;
We&rsquo;re going to sing. All rise.&rdquo; And
the meeting was closed, the members
groping their way down the attic stairs
which by now were quite dark. But the
effect of the club was to be far-reaching
as was afterward shown, though it was
little suspected at the time of its formation.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="desc">A THANKSGIVING DINNER</p>


<p>The first direct effect of the club was
far from pleasant to Edna, for she forgot
all about studying a certain lesson, and
did not remember about it till she and
Dorothy met at school on Monday morning,
and then she was overcome with
fear lest she should be called upon to
recite something of which she knew
scarcely anything. However, by dint of
peeps at the book between whiles, after
devoting to it all the time she had before
school was called to order, she managed
to get through the recitation, yet not
without many misgivings and a rapid
beating of the heart when Miss Ashurst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
called upon her. Edna was always such
a conscientious child about her lessons
that Miss Ashurst rather overlooked the
fact that upon this occasion she was not
quite as glib as usual, and she took her
seat with a feeling of great relief, determining
that she would not forget her
lessons another Saturday.</p>

<p>There was more than one opportunity
that day to exercise the rule of the G. R.
Club, and the girls of the Neighborhood
Club, as they called theirs, were a little
surprised at the appearance of good-will
shown by the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know just what they are up to,&rdquo;
Clara Adams told her friends; &ldquo;they
want to get in with us and are being extra
sweet. I know that is exactly their trick.
Don&rsquo;t you girls pay any attention to
them. Of course we could let Jennie
Ramsey in, because she lives on our
street, but the others, we couldn&rsquo;t any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
more than we could Betty Lowndes or
Jessie Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to me if they are good
enough for Jennie Ramsey to go with
they are good enough for us,&rdquo; returned
Nellie Haskell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to have them,&rdquo;
replied Clara, &ldquo;and if you choose to go
over to them, Nellie Haskell, you can just
make up your mind that I&rsquo;ll have no
more to do with you.&rdquo; So Nellie succumbed
although she did smile upon
Dorothy when the two met and was most
pleasant when Edna offered to show her
about one of the lessons.</p>

<p>Agnes advised that the girls make no
secret of their club. &ldquo;It is nothing to be
ashamed of, I am sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and if
any of the girls want to join it I am sure
they are quite welcome to.&rdquo; And indeed
it did appeal so strongly to some of the
older girls that before the week was out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
several new members were enrolled, and
it was decided to change the time of meeting
to Friday afternoon so that those in
the city might have their convenience considered
while the girls living in the
country could easily stay in till a later
hour.</p>

<p>The little girls felt themselves rather
overpowered by the coming into their
ranks of so many older members, but on
the other hand they felt not a little flattered
at being important enough to belong
to the same club, so as the rule worked
both ways it made it all right, especially
as Betty Lowndes and others were
admitted and were no older than themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They may have more in number,&rdquo;
said Clara when she was told of how the
club was increasing, &ldquo;but we are more
exclusive, my mother says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark made its impression as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Clara intended it should, though Nellie
looked wistfully across at where half a
dozen little girls were joyously eating
their lunch and discussing the good times
the elder girls were planning. &ldquo;You
know,&rdquo; Agnes had told them, &ldquo;if you
want to become a junior branch of the
same club it will be perfectly easy for
you to do it. At the end of a month you
can decide, though Helen Darby and
Florence Gittings agree with me that
there is no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t all
hang together. It will be more convenient
for one thing and we can take turns
in arranging the entertainment part. I
don&rsquo;t see why we all shouldn&rsquo;t enjoy
some of the same kind of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;d much rather stay in,&rdquo;
replied Edna. &ldquo;At least I would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would! I would!&rdquo; came from all
the others.</p>

<p>Although there is a high and marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
difference between fifteen and eight or
nine, in most matters, in this of the club
there appeared to be a harmony which
put them all on the same footing. The
older sisters were more ready to help the
younger ones with their lessons while the
younger ones were more eager to run on
errands or to wait on the older ones, in
consequence there was a benefit all
around.</p>

<p>Of course Miss Ashurst and Mr. Horner
were by no means unaware of what
was going on and they smiled to see how
pleasant an atmosphere prevailed in the
school all except in the unfortunate
Neighborhood Club which they would
have gladly disbanded. &ldquo;It will probably
die of its own discontent,&rdquo; said Miss
Ashurst to the principal, &ldquo;I give it just
three months to exist for the girls are
dropping out one by one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Homer smiled and nodded his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
head. He was a man of few words yet
very little escaped his keen eyes.</p>

<p>The next meeting of the G. R.&rsquo;s was
even more successful than the first. A
number of things were discussed and the
little girls learned many things that they
had not known before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose Clara Adams did want to
come into the club or wanted to be friends
I suppose we&rsquo;d have to be kind to her,&rdquo;
said Dorothy, a little regretfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;d have to be kind to
her,&rdquo; said Helen Darby, &ldquo;but you
wouldn&rsquo;t have to clasp her around the
neck and hang on her words, nor even
visit her. One can be kind without
being intimate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was putting it in rather a new
light and the little girls looked at one
another. They had not easily distinguished
the difference before this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same way about Mr. Horner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>&rdquo;
Helen went on, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to get
down and tie his shoes, but if you do have
a chance to do something to make things
pleasanter for him, why just trot along
and do it.&rdquo; And Helen nodded her head
emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear oh, me,&rdquo; sighed Florence, &ldquo;we
are getting our standards way up. I
should probably fall all over myself if
I attempted to do anything for him. I
am almost scared to death at the mere
thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t bite you,&rdquo; replied Helen,
&ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t have to get close enough
to him to comb his eyebrows. What I
mean is that we can &lsquo;be diligent and
studious&rsquo; as the old copy-books used to
have it, speak well of his school, and not
carry tales home that will make our
families think we are martyrs and that
he is an ogre, or someone to be feared
constantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen Darby! I&rsquo;d like to know who
has been giving you all these new ideas,&rdquo;
said Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I think Mrs. Conway started
them by the way she talked to Agnes, and
I have a modest claim to some brains of
my own, so I thought out the rest and
talked it over with father who put things
very clearly before me, and showed me
that school-girls are half the time silly
geese who seem to think their teachers
are created for the mere purpose of making
their lives miserable. Father said
that the shoe was usually on the other
foot, and that the girls were much more
liable to make the teachers&rsquo; lives miserable.
That set me a-thinking. Let me
remark in passing that father says he
thinks our club is great, and he wants to
have a hand in furnishing the entertaining
some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This announcement made quite a ripple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of excitement, for Mr. Darby did nothing
by halves and it was expected that there
would be a good time for the G. R.&rsquo;s when
they met at Helen&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>Edna kept in mind what had been said
about Uncle Justus and before very long
came an opportunity to prove her powers
of doing him a kindness. It was just
before Thanksgiving that Mrs. Conway
came in one Thursday afternoon to see
Aunt Elizabeth and of course her own two
little daughters as well. Edna sat very
close to her mother on the sofa, her hand
stroking the smooth kid glove she wore.</p>

<p>It was a queer thing to have her mother
for company, but it was very delightful,
too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you and Uncle Justus can
come out to take Thanksgiving dinner
with us,&rdquo; said Mrs. Conway to her aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear, but I am afraid
it is impossible,&rdquo; was the response. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
long ago promised to go to sister Julia&rsquo;s,
and hoped Justus would go, too, but he
insists that he cannot possibly take the
time, for it is something of a trip. He
says he has some school papers he must
attend to, and moreover, has promised to
address a meeting in the afternoon, so
that it will be impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Conway,
&ldquo;for we had quite counted on you
both. Perhaps Uncle Justus can take
the time to come to us even if he cannot
go so far as Aunt Julia&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Homer shook her head. &ldquo;I am
afraid not, but you can ask him. Julia
will be greatly disappointed, but you know
Justus is nothing if not conscientious
and if he has made up his mind he ought
not to go, nothing will alter his decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is his meeting?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Conway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;At half past two, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, then I am afraid it will be
difficult for him to get to us, or rather
to get away. We are to have dinner at
two rather than in the evening, partly
on account of the children and partly on
account of the maids, to whom I have
promised the time after they have finished
the necessary work. There is a train at
two-forty-five, but that would be too late,
and it takes nearly an hour by the trolley
cars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am afraid he will have to dine
alone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Horner, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
he has ever done such a thing in his
life as that, but it cannot be helped.
Julia has few opportunities of seeing her
family and he insists that I must not
think of disappointing her on his account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna listened very soberly to all this,
and when it was learned later that noth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>ing
could alter Uncle Justus&rsquo;s decision,
she felt very sorry for him. She took
occasion to open up the subject herself
that afternoon. &ldquo;Uncle Justus,&rdquo; she
asked, &ldquo;did you ever eat Thanksgiving
dinner alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Justus looked at her over his
spectacles. &ldquo;Well, no, I cannot say that
I ever did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you like to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not believe I shall particularly
enjoy it, but duty must come before
pleasure, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you were going to have dinner
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be very agreeable to me,
but I fear I cannot think of it upon this
occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna sighed. She had hoped he might
reconsider it. When he had left the
room she went out into the kitchen to see
Ellen of whom she was very fond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ellen,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;are you going to stay
in and cook Uncle Justus&rsquo;s Thanksgiving
dinner for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thot. It&rsquo;ll not be much of a job
I&rsquo;ll be havin&rsquo; ayther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! Isn&rsquo;t he going to have a real
Thanksgiving dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was tellin&rsquo; me this mornin&rsquo; thot
it would be aisy, and I cud have me
afthernoon the same as usual, for he&rsquo;d not
be in. Says she, &rsquo;a bit av a chicken will
do and ye can make a pumpkin pie the
day before, so what with a few pertaties
and a taste of stewed tomats he&rsquo;ll do
bravely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; Edna sighed again as she
thought of all that would be served at
her own home table. Her little face wore
a very serious and troubled look every
time she looked at Uncle Justus that evening
and the next day at recess she
unburdened her heart to Dorothy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Jennie. These three always ate their
lunch together and they took this opportunity
for many a confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; Edna began smoothing down
her frock and folding her hands. &ldquo;I
have a chance to do Uncle Justus a kindness
and I can&rsquo;t make up my mind to do
it. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m awfully selfish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see anybody
who&rsquo;s less so, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Jennie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly would. Edna, tell us
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see Uncle Justus has things
to do so he can&rsquo;t go with Aunt Elizabeth
to her sister&rsquo;s and he hasn&rsquo;t even time to
come to us for Thanksgiving, and he
will have to eat his dinner all alone,
unless&mdash;unless I stay and keep him company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh Edna, and you couldn&rsquo;t be with
your family last year because you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
here.&rdquo; Dorothy&rsquo;s tones were almost awe-stricken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, and of course I am dying to
be at home, and that&rsquo;s where the being
selfish comes in, I keep thinking how I
should hate to eat my dinner alone and
every time I look at Uncle Justus I feel
so sorry for him I can hardly stand it,
then when I think of not going home I
feel so sorry for myself I can scarcely
stand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both girls were silent. They saw the
opportunity for heroic sacrifice as well
as Edna did, but they could not advise her
either way; it was too weighty a question,
though Jennie ventured, &ldquo;If he is going
to be busy all the time you would be all
by yourself except at dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Edna nodded, &ldquo;and Ellen is
going out after she gets the dishes done,
but I suppose I could go home after that.
She could put me on the trolley and I&rsquo;d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
get home in an hour. I thought about
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be like staying
all day, would it?&rdquo; said Dorothy, brightening
a little as she saw this much light
upon the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course that would make a
great difference,&rdquo; returned Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; Jennie had a sudden brilliant
thought. &ldquo;Oh, Edna, I wonder if you
couldn&rsquo;t come to my house and stay all
night with me. I should be so delighted
to have you and I know mother would,
too. We aren&rsquo;t to have our Thanksgiving
dinner till six, so you could have
two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna looked quite happy as this plan
was suggested. What girl of nine does
not delight in such an experience as
spending the night with a friend? The
thought of two Thanksgiving dinners,
though one might be rather a frugal one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
had its charm, too. &ldquo;I think that would
be perfectly lovely,&rdquo; she said, then after
a moment&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;but you must ask
your mother first and I&rsquo;ll ask mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask her as soon as I go home and
will tell you at the club meeting this afternoon,
and then you can ask your mother
when you get home and let me know on
Monday. I just know what mother will
say before I ask her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the bell rang and recess was over,
but Edna returned to her lessons very
happy at this solution of what had been a
matter of deep thought. It turned out
just as Jennie had prophesied, for she
brought a veritable invitation to Edna
that afternoon in the shape of a little
note, and she further said that Mrs. Ramsey
meant to make sure by writing a
formal request to Mrs. Conway, therefore
Edna considered the matter as good
as settled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>She was full of the subject that afternoon
when she reached home. It was
quite dark although she and the others
had taken the train which brought them
more quickly. The club meetings were
so interesting that it was hard to get away
in time, but Mrs. Conway was on the
watch as the girls came in the gate. Of
course Edna had told Celia about all this,
and indeed it had been talked over at the
club, all the girls agreeing that it was a
perfectly lovely thing for Edna to do, so
she came in quite exalted by all the
approval.</p>

<p>However, when she told her tale and
her mother saw that it was a case of genuine
desire to do a good deed, and that in
the beginning it had appeared in the light
of a heavier sacrifice than could be made
easily, she felt that she could allow the
child to do as she wished, being sure that
it was not in a spirit of self-righteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>ness.
And so, on the evening before
Thanksgiving after Uncle Justus had
returned from seeing Mrs. Horner safely
on her journey to her sister&rsquo;s, he saw a
little figure watching for him at the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, little girl,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;how is this? I thought you would have
been at home before now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going till Friday,&rdquo; replied
Edna smiling up at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
stay and have Thanksgiving dinner with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What? What?&rdquo; Uncle Justus
frowned and shook his head, but he
took off his spectacles and wiped them
very vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo; Edna was very decided.
&ldquo;Mother said I might, and oh, Uncle
Justus, she knew Aunt Elizabeth would
be away and she thought maybe you and
I would like some of our Thanksgiving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
so she has sent some of her goodies, and
we&rsquo;re going to have a lovely time. I am
going to help Ellen set the table and wipe
the dishes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my child, I cannot allow it. No,
no, no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, please.&rdquo; The more Uncle
Justus denied, the more anxious was
Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my child, it would be selfish and
inconsiderate of me in the extreme to
take you away from your family on a
holiday. I know what it means to little
people to have such treats, and to an old
fellow like me it will not make such a difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you told me you had never had a
Thanksgiving dinner alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite true, but it is no reason
why I should call upon a little girl like
you to give up the holiday to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me to stay?&rdquo; asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Edna wistfully, and feeling a little hurt
lest after all, her sacrifice was not really
needed.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Justus did a rare thing.
He sat down, put his arm around her and
kissed her on the cheek. &ldquo;My dear little
girl,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if that is the way you
feel, I can only say that I am delighted
beyond measure that you want to stay,
and you will give me a greater cause for
thanksgiving than I have expected or
deserved,&rdquo; and he drew her to his knee.</p>

<p>Edna smiled as she wondered what
Florence Gittings, or any of the other
girls, for that matter, would say if they
could see her then so extremely near the
fierce eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what will you do in the afternoon?&rdquo;
asked Uncle Justus after a
moment. &ldquo;I must go out early, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that. At first I thought I
would get Ellen to put me on the cars to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
go home. It would be quite safe, for I
have gone so many times, but Jennie
Ramsey and her mother have invited me
to come there to stay all night. I&rsquo;ll come
back here on Friday, if you would like me
to, Uncle Justus. I could stay till Aunt
Elizabeth comes home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Justus was silent for a moment.
He smoothed her hair thoughtfully and
then he said gently. &ldquo;Your mother very
kindly has asked me to spend the week
end with you all, so suppose we go out
together on Friday afternoon. I can
take my papers with me and do my necessary
work on Saturday there as well as
here. Your little club meets on Friday
afternoon, doesn&rsquo;t it? I will meet you
and Celia at the station in time for the
four-thirty train, which is the one you
usually take, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna was surprised that Uncle Justus
should know all this about the club and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the time of their going home, but she
didn&rsquo;t say so. &ldquo;I think that will be a
very nice plan,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
back here on Friday morning and have
dinner with you, and then I can go to the
club meeting. It is to be at Helen
Darby&rsquo;s this time, and that is very near,
you know.&rdquo; The twilight gathered about
the two and in the dim light Uncle Justus
did not appear in the least a person to
stand in awe of, for when Ellen came to
call them to supper she was surprised to
see the little girl still sitting on the old
man&rsquo;s knee, his arm around her and her
head on his shoulder.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="desc">IN A BLIZZARD</p>


<p>The enjoyment of helping Ellen, of
setting the table and of being consulted
on such important subjects as whether the
best china and the finest tablecloth should
be used almost made up to Edna for being
away from home on Thanksgiving day.
The basket sent by Mrs. Conway contained
several things which made the
dinner much more of a feast than it
would otherwise have been, for there was
a jar of tomato soup, a small chicken pie
with scalloped leaves and little balls of
crust on top, some delicious pickles, a
glass of currant jelly and another of cranberry
sauce. Margaret had brought in a
bunch of cut flowers from Mrs. MacDon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>ald&rsquo;s
greenhouse, the day before and
these set in the middle of the table were
a lovely ornament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the foinest lookin&rsquo; table iver I
saw in this house,&rdquo; said Ellen when Edna
called her in to see. &ldquo;What was it yez
were sayin&rsquo; about thim little toasty crusts
for the soup. I&rsquo;d be afther makin&rsquo; thim
if I cud know wanst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can tell you just how,&rdquo; said
Edna, &ldquo;for I have watched our cook make
them.&rdquo; She felt very important to be
overseeing this piece of cookery and went
in to call her uncle, feeling very much
pleased at what had been accomplished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle
Justus, &ldquo;this does look like holiday times.
Who did all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ellen and I,&rdquo; Edna told him, &ldquo;and it
was lots of fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Justus nodded. &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo;
he said with a smile, as he sat down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>It was really a merrier repast than
Edna had ever eaten under that roof, for
instead of eating his dinner in silence as
he generally did, Uncle Justus was quite
talkative and actually attempted to joke
once in a while. When Ellen was taking
away the plates before she served the
dessert, the old gentleman arose. &ldquo;I
think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this is just the
occasion to open that jar of ginger Captain
Doane sent me awhile ago.&rdquo; So he
went to his own special cupboard, unlocked
the door and brought forth the
wicker bound ginger jar which had been
there several weeks, and it is safe to say
Edna was given her share.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A famous dinner,&rdquo; said Uncle Justus
as he rose from the table. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
remember that I ever had a pleasanter
one, and I have you to thank for it, my
dear. Now, I am afraid I shall have to
go to my meeting, but I know you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
an agreeable plan for the evening, so I do
not feel the reluctance in leaving that I
should otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna helped him on with his overcoat,
handed him his walking stick and saw
him off, standing in the door, and hoping
he would look back. He did this giving
her a smile and nod as she waved her
hand. Then she went back to Ellen and
together they did the dishes very carefully.
After this both must get dressed,
and an hour later they were about to start
when the bell rang and Ellen opened the
door to Jennie Ramsey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d just come for you in the
motor car,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mother said
Mack could take us for a little ride in the
fresh air so we would have a better appetite
for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was quite exciting, for Edna&rsquo;s
opportunities for riding in an automobile
were not many.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The magnificence of the Ramsey&rsquo;s
dinner far outdid Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s, but
Edna did not enjoy it one whit the more,
although it was very delightful to be
served by a man in livery, and to have
such exquisite china and glass to look
at during the meal. The child felt a
little shy in the presence of so many
strangers, and had little to say. Moreover,
she had too often been told by Aunt
Elizabeth that &ldquo;little children should be
seen and not heard&rdquo; for her not to remember
she must not chatter. Really the best
time came when she and Jennie went up
to bed when Jennie showed her all her
treasures, her pretty room and her rows
of books. They became very confidential
as they snuggled down under the covers,
and when Mrs. Ramsey came in to kiss
them both good-night, Edna felt much
happier than had seemed possible she
could be when she first considered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
she must spend the day and night away
from her mother.</p>

<p>The club meeting at Helen Darby&rsquo;s the
next day was a fine affair, too, for Mr.
Darby had provided an entertainment
which pleased them all. A wonderful
juggler did all sorts of curious tricks and
a young man sang the drollest of songs.
Then, too, the refreshments were unusually
good. It had been made an inviolable
rule that not more than three articles
were to be served, but when there were
ice cream, delicious cakes and bon-bons,
surely these were quite enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Helen in explanation,
after some of the girls had protested,
&ldquo;father said this was a holiday meeting
and it might be a little more elaborate, he
thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Uncle Justus took Edna and Celia home
that evening, and if he did not enjoy his
visit it was not the fault of the girls. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
is probable the old gentleman had rarely
had such attentions and such a fuss made
over him. He was invited to the Evans&rsquo;s
to supper on Saturday and to Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s
to dinner on Sunday. He was
taken to drive; he was invited to walk,
and really was quite overcome by all this
thought of him from the members of the
G. R. Club.</p>

<p>Monday morning saw everyone but Celia
back at school. Celia having had too
much Thanksgiving, or too much something
was not able to go, and indeed, had
to remain at home for the entire week,
and it seemed very much like the old days
to Edna when she had to stay at Uncle
Justus&rsquo;s without her sister. Aunt Elizabeth
returned home on Monday afternoon,
quite &ldquo;smoothed out&rdquo; Edna told her
mother afterward. So the week sped
along in the old way till Friday afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>It had begun to snow a little when Edna
started out to the club meeting which was
held at Florence Gittings&rsquo;s. The little
girl had no fear, however, for she expected
to meet Dorothy and Agnes and go home
with them, but for some reason neither
was present. Later on it was learned that
Mr. Evans had called for them at their
aunt&rsquo;s and had taken them home fearing
a heavy storm would prevent their going
later. A telegram which they sent to
Edna at Florence Gittings&rsquo;s was not delivered
till after the child had left the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going off by yourself,&rdquo;
said Florence when the club meeting was
over. It had seemed rather a poor little
affair after the brilliancy of Helen&rsquo;s entertainment,
and with both Agnes and Celia
missing. However they had all done
their best, but it broke up rather earlier
than usual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I must go,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;I am
sure Agnes and Dorothy will be at the
railway station, and we can all go out
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is snowing so hard and the wind
is making the snow drift,&rdquo; continued
Florence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but the cars go all the way to the
station. I won&rsquo;t have to walk, and very
likely mother will send one of the boys,
Cousin Ben, perhaps, to meet me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a telephone,&rdquo; said
Florence, &ldquo;but we haven&rsquo;t, and I suppose
you can telephone from the station if you
want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might do that,&rdquo; said Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better go back to your
Uncle Horner&rsquo;s,&rdquo; suggested Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;&rdquo; Edna did not want to do
this. A whole week at the school without
Celia was about all she thought she could
stand. &ldquo;I shall do all right,&rdquo; she in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>sisted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the girls will be at the
station.&rdquo; So the others saw her depart
without urging her further.</p>

<p>Owing to the snow which was drifting
heavily, the cars were running much more
slowly than usual, and when Edna reached
the station her train had just gone. It
was the train her father always took and
she had hoped to see him. She decided
to telephone and took out her purse to see
what money she had. Alas! she had but
ten cents, not enough for an out-of-town
toll. She had her school ticket fortunately.
Celia was the one who always
carried the money for the expenses, and
Edna remembered that her mother had
told her to be sure to provide herself with
enough. &ldquo;If you find you run short,&rdquo;
she told the child, &ldquo;either send down to
your father for some change or borrow
it from Aunt Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna would rather have done almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
anything than borrow from Aunt Elizabeth
and she had forgotten to look in her
purse anyhow, before starting. &ldquo;Even if
I had,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;I would have
thought I had enough for I didn&rsquo;t expect
to need anything but car fare.&rdquo; The next
train would leave at five, but as it was a
short run Edna thought she might venture
to take it, even though it might be
dark when she reached the station. She
could telephone to the house from there,
if necessary. So she waited patiently till
it should be time for her train to be ready
and then she went out and took her seat.
It was snowing desperately hard she
noticed as they moved along, and the train
stopped frequently, but at last she reached
her own station and got off feeling very
thankful to be this near home. She
looked around; not a soul was there to
meet her. She would have to telephone.
She turned toward the waiting-room, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to her consternation found the door
locked.</p>

<p>There was not a soul in sight. She
stood still for a while. It was getting
colder, and the snow was drifting and
swirling around at a great rate. What
should she do? The station master had
probably gone home to his supper, for
there were no more trains till nearly six
o&rsquo;clock from either direction. He had not
counted on his presence being needed between
whiles once he had seen to his
freight and baggage, and he had gone to
the back of the building where he lived.</p>

<p>It was not more than a ten minutes&rsquo;
walk to her home in good weather, and
Edna at last thought she would venture.
She pulled her hat down over her ears
and her coat collar up around her neck
and started. It was desperate walking
here in the country where the sharp wind
seemed to search out every unprotected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
part of the body. The snow nearly
blinded her, and cut her face like a knife.
Every little while she had to stop to get
breath, and as she found the difficulties
increasing she thought of all the stories
she had heard of persons perishing in the
snow a few yards from their own door-ways.
&ldquo;I wish I had gone back to Uncle
Justus,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Oh, dear, I
don&rsquo;t believe I will ever get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whiteness of the snow made it
possible for her to see a little of the way
when she first started, but as she went on
and it grew darker she began to wonder
if she were in the road. She brushed
away the stinging flakes and looked
around, peering into the darkness gathering
around her. Through the blinding,
hurrying flakes she could see twinkling
lights here and there, and presently she
located the piece of woods just beyond
her own home, but it was far to the left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and she realized that she had turned into
a by-road instead of keeping to the main
one. The tears began to course down her
cheeks when she appreciated how far she
was from her own house. &ldquo;I can never
go back,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I am
so cold and so tired, I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t
get there. It would never do to stand
still,&rdquo; she realized and presently she made
up her mind to struggle on toward the
nearest light a little ahead.</p>

<p>She bowed her head again and pressed
on through the drifts, feeling her strength
would do no more than get her to this
refuge. At last it was reached, a little
house, by the wayside, a tiny garden in
front and a small cow-shed behind. Managing
to get the gate open, Edna went
upon the porch and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>It was opened by a little girl about her
own age. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;who
is it? I thought you were mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Come right in out of the storm. Isn&rsquo;t it
a dreadful one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna, scarce able to speak, tottered into
the room, warm from a bright fire in a
base-burner stove and cheerful by reason
of a lighted lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are all covered with snow,&rdquo; the
little girl went on. &ldquo;Do come to the fire
and take off your hat and coat. You
must be nearly frozen and I expect your
feet are wet and cold. I&rsquo;ll take off your
shoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stooped down and began to unfasten
the snowy shoes after removing
the rubbers Edna had been fortunate
enough to have put on.</p>

<p>In a moment the wanderer was able to
tell her story, and to thank her little
hostess for her attentions. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what I am going to do,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t get home, and there
isn&rsquo;t any way to send them word to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
for me. Of course they will think I have
stayed in the city. If I had known how
bad the storm was going to be I would
never have started, but I did want to see
my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I want to see my mother,&rdquo; replied
her hostess. &ldquo;She went down the
road this morning to see my aunt who is
ill, and she was coming back on this train
that got in a little while ago, the train you
must have come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anyone get off,&rdquo; Edna
told her, &ldquo;only two or three men who got
into a wagon and drove off before I left
the station. Most everyone I know
comes out on the train before that, but I
missed it, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am very glad to have you
here,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;If mother did not
come on that train she won&rsquo;t come at all,
I am sure, for the next ones don&rsquo;t stop
at my aunt&rsquo;s station, and I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
been here all alone. What is your
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Edna Conway, and I live
on the main road just this side of that
piece of woods you see after you pass
Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s. Hers is the big gray
house with the greenhouses, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I know it very well. My
name is Nettie Black. My mother and I
live here just by ourselves since my
father died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Edna felt very sorry that Nettie
was fatherless, but she did not know exactly
what to say about it. &ldquo;Will your
mother be worried about your being here
alone?&rdquo; she asked after a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose she will, but it can&rsquo;t be helped.
I know she would have come if she could.
I only hope my aunt isn&rsquo;t worse. I wish
she could know I am not to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wish, my mother knew I was
safe,&rdquo; returned Edna. &ldquo;I am sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
though, that she thinks I am at my
uncle&rsquo;s in the city, and I hope she does
think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you quite warm, now?&rdquo; asked
Nettie. &ldquo;If you are we will have some
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are very kind,&rdquo; returned
Edna a little embarrassed. &ldquo;I think it
is very hard on you to have me come in
this way like a stray cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie laughed. &ldquo;I like stray cats, and
we always take them in. There is a
lovely one in the kitchen, now, that we
make a great pet of. He came to us so
thin and miserable, but now he is as fat
as butter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see him,&rdquo; returned Edna,
&ldquo;and won&rsquo;t you let me help you get
supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t so very much to get,&rdquo; returned
Nettie a little shamefacedly.
&ldquo;There is only bread and butter and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
is left of the rice-pudding I had for
dinner. We could toast the bread, and
there&rsquo;s milk. If you don&rsquo;t mind my taking
part of the milk for it, I could have
milk-toast and we could drink cambric
tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like cambric tea,&rdquo; replied Edna,
&ldquo;and I am very fond of milk-toast. Oh,
dear, I am so thankful to be here instead
of out in the cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thankful, too. I&rsquo;ll go out and
make the toast. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna was pleased enough to do this, to
make the acquaintance of the big black
cat, and to help make the toast. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see how you will ever know how to make
the dip part,&rdquo; she said to Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do know. Mother taught
me, and I can do it very well. The great
thing is not to let the milk burn and to
put in only the least little bit of thickening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna watched the process admiringly.
Nettie was so very expert and bustled
around like an experienced housekeeper.
The house was very small, only two rooms
downstairs and two up, with an attic over
all, but everything was neat and clean,
and the dishes, of course, were set out in
an orderly manner upon a white tablecloth.
The dish of smoking toast flanked
by the rice pudding made an excellent
meal. Nettie poured the tea and served
her guest in the most hospitable way.
They ate their meal in the front room before
the fire, and now that she was
warmed and was no longer hungry, Edna
began to be interested in her surroundings.
It was a plainly furnished room,
a faded carpet on the floor, an old-fashioned
sofa against one wall, a claw-footed
mahogany table against the other, a bookcase
between the windows. One or two
engravings hung on the wall and a dingy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
portrait in an old frame. The chairs
matched the sofa, one being a comfortable
rocker with cover of haircloth.</p>

<p>After they had washed the supper
dishes, Nettie made ready for the night
by putting more coal on the fires and
carefully barring the shutters and doors
below. Then with a small lamp in her
hand she escorted her guest to the upstairs
room. It was rather chilly and
was also plainly furnished, though the
old-fashioned four-poster bed was made
up neatly, and the high bureau showed a
clean cover. The wind howled and
whistled around the house, the sharp
snow crystals clicked against the panes,
but as Edna crept under the covers she
could feel only thankful that she had this
shelter and was soon asleep with Nettie
beside her already in the land of Dreams.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="desc">COUSIN BEN TO THE RESCUE</p>


<p>The next morning when Edna opened
her eyes she saw a white world. Trees,
fences, roofs, were covered with snow.
It was banked up in great drifts along
the road. The path to the gate was so
deeply snowed under that it was an impossibility
to think of getting from the
house. At the back it was no better.
The two little girls looked rather sober.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if mother can get home to-day,&rdquo;
was the first thought in Nettie&rsquo;s
mind, and, &ldquo;I wonder if I can get home
to my mother,&rdquo; was that in Edna&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It seemed rather forlorn to think of
facing the day without some older person,
but Nettie bravely went to work to do her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
best. First she went down into the cellar
for coal which she lugged up to put on the
two fires. Edna came down to find her
busily taking up the ashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how do you know what to do to
make the fires burn?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, for mother has told me,
and I often do this for her. The kitchen
fire is easy enough but it is hard to lift the
coal bucket up high enough to get the
coal into the other stove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can help,&rdquo; said Edna. So together
they managed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I must see what there is for
breakfast,&rdquo; said Nettie. &ldquo;I think there
are two eggs, and the hens must have laid
more, but I can&rsquo;t get out to hunt them till
a path is made. I think there is still a
little milk, for it didn&rsquo;t take much for
the cambric tea, and we can have more of
that. Then there is bread enough and
butter. We can boil the eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This they did, Edna watching the clock
very carefully to see that they were not
over done. They concluded to toast the
bread, and made a pretty fair breakfast,
though it was not a very hearty one, Edna
thought. There was a little of the milk
toast left which they warmed up to give
to the cat who must miss his morning&rsquo;s
milk, as the milkman had not appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he will get here at
all,&rdquo; said Nettie a little anxiously. She
was wondering what she could give her
guest for dinner if it should be so that
her mother did not return. She set to
work in a very housewifely way to tidy up
the house, Edna helping all she could.
Then they stationed themselves by the
window to see if by any chance there
might be someone coming along whom
they could hail. But the road was not
much frequented and there was not a footstep
nor a track in the deep snow. Only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the smoke from neighboring chimneys
gave any evidence of life. Once they
heard sleigh-bells in the distance and concluded
that the main road was being used.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could get out to feed the
chickens,&rdquo; said Nettie after a while. &ldquo;I
am afraid they will be hungry.&rdquo; She
went to the back door to view the prospect,
and tried to shovel away some of
the snow, but it was slow work. Edna
brought another shovel and together they
managed to clear a few feet of the path,
but it was very wearying and they soon
had to give it up.</p>

<p>Then they went back to the window,
but the monotony was not relieved by any
change in the face of things and so they
determined that it was rather stupid to
stand there. Nettie brought down her
two dolls and they played with these for
a while, but keeping house in a make believe
way was not so exciting when there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was the reality close at hand, and they
decided that paper dolls would be more
entertaining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there is a fashion book upstairs
in the garret,&rdquo; said Nettie, &ldquo;and
we can take that. Mother said I might
have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna followed her up into the attic and
they found the book, took it down into the
front room and began to make their selections
and cut out paper dolls till it suddenly
dawned upon Nettie that it was time
for another meal. She laid down her
scissors with a sigh. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t
know what we shall have for dinner,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Mother was going to bring something
back with her. I shall have to
rummage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the little pantry, Edna
following. &ldquo;There are two potatoes, but
they aren&rsquo;t very big,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
there is some codfish. I might make some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
codfish balls if I knew how. Do you
know, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they are made of fish and
potatoes, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I don&rsquo;t know how much fish
and how much potato, besides I am afraid
there aren&rsquo;t potatoes enough. I suppose
we shall have to give that up. Oh, here
are some more eggs; that is fine. If I
could find some ham or some bacon we
could have ham and eggs, and that would
be very good.&rdquo; But nothing of this kind
could be discovered and Nettie brought
out the potatoes, laid them on the table
and said rather ruefully, &ldquo;It seems to me
that we aren&rsquo;t going to have much dinner.
There isn&rsquo;t another thing except sugar
and tea and such things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might be rice,&rdquo; said Edna with
a sudden thought of Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s
desserts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, and rice and brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sugar are very good indeed. I am so glad
you thought of it. I know there must be
rice.&rdquo; She went back to the pantry and
presently came out with a box in which
she had discovered the rice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the
eggs and we can have them fried,&rdquo; she
remarked, &ldquo;they will seem more like
meat that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we can have the potatoes baked
because they will be easier to do,&rdquo; said
Edna.</p>

<p>Nettie made another visit to the pantry.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found something else,&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Edna going to the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two apples. Now, I am sure that is
every blessed thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Edna cheerfully, &ldquo;I think
we are very lucky to find so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must put the potatoes in the oven
right away,&rdquo; <a name="tn108" id="tn108"></a>declared <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'Nettie, for it'">Nettie, &ldquo;for it</ins> takes
them a good while to bake. I will put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
some water for the rice, too. I wonder
how much rice I should take. Have you
any idea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, but I should think we
will want quite a good deal, we haven&rsquo;t
very much else, have we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we have not. I will take a large
cupful. It swells up so, I should think
that might do. You soak it first, I think.&rdquo;
She measured out a full cup of the rice,
poured some water over it, washed it and
then set it to soak till the water should
boil. The potatoes were put in the oven
and then the two went back to the next
room. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take the rice as long as
it does the potatoes, I am sure,&rdquo; said
Nettie, &ldquo;and the water will have to boil
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They returned to the paper-dolls, becoming
quite interested in them till presently
they heard a great sputtering, and
running out found the water was boiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put on the rice now,&rdquo; said
Nettie, &ldquo;for I am getting hungry, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, a little,&rdquo; acknowledged
Edna.</p>

<p>Nettie was rather uncertain as to what
she should cook the rice in, and next, how
much water she should pour over it, but
after some discussion it was decided, and
they went back to set the table. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
it seem funny to be keeping house just
like grown-ups?&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;I never
knew how much trouble it was before, did
you, Nettie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew, but I didn&rsquo;t think about it, I
suppose,&rdquo; returned Nettie. &ldquo;We will
pile up our dolls and papers over here
on this other table and then they will be
easy to get at when we want them. I
wish the milkman had come, for I really
don&rsquo;t know what to give to Tippy. We
haven&rsquo;t any meat. To be sure he will eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
most anything, but I am afraid he will
go hungry to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you give him an egg and
some bread or some rice, if we have
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could do that, I suppose. I hope
there will be rice enough, but it is very
hard to tell when you aren&rsquo;t acquainted
with such a thing as the boiling and swelling
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I smell something burning,&rdquo; cried
Edna, &ldquo;and something is making a
funny popping noise.&rdquo; They flew to the
kitchen to see that the rice had burst all
bounds and was dancing out of the saucepan
all over the hot stove, puffing and
popping at a great rate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; exclaimed Nettie. &ldquo;I
never saw so much rice come from one
cupful. Could you believe it? Why, it
has taken up all the water and the saucepan
is full up to the top besides all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
is on the stove. Oh, dear, I wish I knew
just how to cook it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a cook book?&rdquo; asked
Edna with a quick suggestion of what
might help out the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course mother has one. I
will set this off and go hunt it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The book was found on the shelves and
the two put their heads together to discover
the best way to boil rice. &ldquo;I think
this seems the easiest way,&rdquo; said Nettie,
pointing to one of the pages of the book,
&ldquo;but I hope it won&rsquo;t hurt it to wait, for
I&rsquo;ll have to put on more water to boil. It
says to have a great deal of water and
keep it boiling like mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some time the rice was transferred
to another and larger saucepan
and was soon boiling &ldquo;like mad,&rdquo; then
the eggs were fried and after a somewhat
anxious and laborious period of time the
dinner was pronounced ready.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, but it is hard work,&rdquo;
said Edna sighing as the two sat down to
partake of the meal which they had prepared
after so much difficulty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is hard work,&rdquo; agreed Nettie,
&ldquo;but we did it all ourselves, and the potatoes
are really done and the rice looks
all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks fine,&rdquo; said Edna, &ldquo;and so do
the eggs. I don&rsquo;t mind their being
broken a little; I don&rsquo;t see how you could
dish them up without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had been so long in preparing the
meal that they were quite starved and ate
with a relish. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad there is more
rice,&rdquo; said Nettie, &ldquo;for now that I know
what a little it takes to make a big dish
I shan&rsquo;t be afraid of our starving while
it lasts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Edna put down her spoon,
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think we shall have to stay
here alone for days, do you? The snow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
will have to melt after a while and the
roads be cleared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look much like it yet,&rdquo; returned
Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it never, never, never could
keep on like this.&rdquo; Edna was determined
to be hopeful. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to believe
someone will come this very afternoon,
either your mother or somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her faith was not without foundation
for along in the middle of the afternoon
they heard jangling bells, and ran to the
front window to see the milkman in a
huge sleigh, his milk cans in the body of
it. He plowed his way to the front door
which was opened to him before he could
knock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Snyder,&rdquo; said Nettie, &ldquo;I am
so glad you have come. We are all alone
and we haven&rsquo;t a drop of milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; said Mr. Snyder. &ldquo;I
thought as much. It&rsquo;s pretty hard trav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>elling
and I&rsquo;ve been hours getting around
to my customers, but now the road is
broken it won&rsquo;t be quite so hard getting
back. I&rsquo;d better leave you double quantity
in case I&rsquo;m late to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are our milkman, too, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;You leave milk at
Mrs. Conway&rsquo;s, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you been there yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m on my way now. You&rsquo;re out
a bit, you know, but what are you doing
down here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna told him her tale in which he was
much interested. &ldquo;Well, I declare,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Want me to take you home with
me? I can bundle you in there with the
milk cans, and I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t
freeze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Edna thought she must
accept this invitation, then she looked at
Nettie. Suppose her mother should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
come that evening, and she should be
there at night all alone. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you
take Nettie, too?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. The two of you
aren&rsquo;t much more than two milk cans, and
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re not so big round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but suppose mother should come,&rdquo;
said Nettie. &ldquo;She would be so worried,
and I must be here to keep up the fires.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Edna firmly, setting her
face against the temptation of the cheerful
supper table at home, the dear mother
arms, the greetings of the boys and all
the rest of it. &ldquo;I will tell you what I
can do. I will write mother a little note
and ask her if she can send somebody or
find some way to get us something to eat,
and I&rsquo;ll stay till your mother comes,
Nettie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think you are lovely to do that,&rdquo;
answered Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you wait a minute, Mr. Sny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>der?&rdquo;
asked Edna. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t write
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; he <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'said, and if'">said, <a name="tn117" id="tn117"></a>&ldquo;and if</ins> you will
give me a shovel I&rsquo;ll make a path to your
gate. I reckon you&rsquo;re right about staying,
sissy. I&rsquo;ve got two little girls of my
own and I know I shouldn&rsquo;t like them to
be left alone either one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna hurried through her note which
said: &ldquo;Dear mother, I am with Nettie
Black. She lives in the first little house
on the side road on the way to the old
mill. We are all alone for her mother
hasn&rsquo;t come back. Please send us something
to eat if you can, for we have nothing
left but rice and milk. There may
be eggs in the hen-house, but we can&rsquo;t
get at them. I want to come but I&rsquo;d
better not. Your loving Edna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little note was safely stowed away
in Mr. Snyder&rsquo;s pocket with a promise
of sure delivery, and he went off, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
horses plunging through the deep drifts
up to their middles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are just as good as you
can be,&rdquo; said Nettie. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel as
if I ought to let you stay, but I do hate
the idea of being left all alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d want you to stay with me if I were
in your place,&rdquo; returned Edna remembering
the G. R. Club. To be sure
Nettie did not belong to her school, but
she was quite as much one of those
&ldquo;others&rdquo; to whom one should do as he
would be done by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really looks as if something had
happened,&rdquo; remarked Edna. &ldquo;When we
see the path to the gate. I wish he had
had time to make one at the back, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was almost dark and they were about
to turn from the window to light the lamp,
when ploughing through the deep snow
they saw someone coming down the road.
They watched him eagerly. Except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
milkman he was the first person they had
seen that day. &ldquo;He is coming this way,&rdquo;
said Edna hopefully. &ldquo;Oh, Nettie, I believe
it is Cousin Ben. He has a basket
and see how he has taken to the road
where Mr. Snyder&rsquo;s sleigh went along.&rdquo;
She watched for a few minutes longer.
&ldquo;It is Cousin Ben,&rdquo; she cried joyfully.
&ldquo;He is coming here. Light the lamp,
Nettie, while I go let him in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried to the door to see Ben
stamping off the snow from his feet.
&ldquo;Whewee!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t this
a sockdolager? I never saw such a
storm? How are you Ande, my honey.
Of all things to think of your being this
near home and none of us knowing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then mother did think I was still at
Uncle Justus&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what she did. You rung a surprise
on the whole of us, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came in and set down the basket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
took off his cap and overcoat and looked
down at the two little girls with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Nettie Black,&rdquo; Edna told him.
&ldquo;She has been so nice to me, and I don&rsquo;t
know what would have happened if I had
not been able to get to her house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it,&rdquo; returned Ben with
a little frown and a shake of his head.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit down and warm myself and then
you can tell me how this all happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew up to the fire, took Edna on
his knee and she poured forth her tale.
&ldquo;Pretty tough,&rdquo; he said when she had
completed her story. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your
mother didn&rsquo;t know you had started.
Now, Miss Nettie if you will let me sleep
on that big sofa I am going to stay right
here till we can dig you out and your
mother comes. There&rsquo;s a lot of provender
in that basket and we&rsquo;ll be as jolly as they
make &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you can sleep upstairs,&rdquo; re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>turned
Nettie. &ldquo;There is plenty of
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Then upstairs be it. What
was that about hens and eggs and things,
Ande?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can&rsquo;t get out to the hen-house,
you know. We tried to make a path but
it was too hard work for us so we gave
it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should remark. Well, that will be
done first thing in the morning, and I&rsquo;ll
go see what I can find. Eggsactly, as it
were. What about the fires? Any coal
up here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Nettie told him. &ldquo;We
have carried up all we could at a time,
but we couldn&rsquo;t bring enough for the
fires to-night. We are going down to get
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going to do no such thing.
Got a candle? Where are the coal
scuttles? One of you hold the light and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
show me your coal bin and up comes your
coal.&rdquo; Cousin Ben was already making
for the cellar door.</p>

<p>Of course no one was going to be left
out of this expedition and all three descended
to the cellar, from which they
presently came forth all laughing. It
was certainly a cheering thing to have
someone so willing to come to their aid.
Next the basket was unpacked and it goes
without saying that there were neither
eggs nor rice for supper that night.
Moreover, Tippy had such a feast of
milk as well as other things as he had
not seen for several days. Ben kept the
little girls in such a state of giggle that
they could scarcely do the dishes, but
what with the labors of the day and the
later excitement they were ready for bed
early, and went up leaving Cousin Ben
with a book before him. Later his light
half wakened Edna, but as he closed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
door between the rooms and she realized
that he was there, she turned over with a
sigh of content, feeling very safe and
sleepy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="desc">DISTURBANCES</p>


<p>Sunday morning was bright and clear.
It was so dazzlingly bright when the little
girls arose that they thought it must be
much later than it was. Cousin Ben,
however, was already up and dressed and
had been down some time when the two
finally descended to the lower floor. This
was made known by reason of the fires
burning brightly and of there being a
path cleared to the hen-house, while as
many as a dozen eggs were in a bowl on
the kitchen table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Ben,&rdquo; cried Edna, &ldquo;what
a lot you have done. It is so cosey and
warm down here, and we won&rsquo;t have to
wait at all for breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m
hungry, for one. What are you going to
have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna turned to Nettie who considered
the question. It was a great occasion
when there were two guests to be provided
for. &ldquo;As long as there are so many
eggs,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we can have muffins or
something and some eggs. I could have
some kind of breakfast food, too, I believe
there&rsquo;s some oat-meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the oat-meal,&rdquo; said Ben.
&ldquo;You get me out the flour and stuff and
I&rsquo;ll make the muffins. There is a royal
fire and I&rsquo;ll get them ready in three
shakes of a sheep&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; Nettie looked amazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Did you never hear of a
man cook? I&rsquo;ve served my apprenticeship,
I can assure you. I&rsquo;ll make the
coffee, too, if you have any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is some already ground, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the basket mother sent,&rdquo; Edna assured
him. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t drink it, but we can
have cambric tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, you go along and set the
table, and I&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie was rather glad to have the responsibility
taken off her hands in this
summary manner, though she said to
Edna, &ldquo;Do you think it is polite to let him
do it all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; replied Edna. &ldquo;He
does those things at home for his mother
sometimes, for he has no sisters, and the
boys have to pitch in and help when the
servant goes out. He has told me all
about it. And as for its being polite, I
remember mother said it was always more
polite to let your company do the thing
which made them comfortable than to insist
upon doing something for them that
would make them uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie considered this for some time be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>fore
she quite took in the sense of it.
She was a thin, demure little girl, not at
all pretty, but with a kind face, big blue
eyes and sandy hair. She was dressed
very plainly, but her clothes were neat and
simply made. She was not the kind of
child Edna might have expected to find
in such a little house.</p>

<p>The muffins turned out a great success,
and Ben said his coffee just suited him.
&ldquo;I never saw fresher eggs than your hens
lay,&rdquo; he said, looking at Nettie with a
serious face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, they are fresh,&rdquo; she returned,
&ldquo;when they were only laid yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I said,&rdquo; returned Ben,
with gravity.</p>

<p>Edna laughed. She was used to Cousin
Ben&rsquo;s ways, but Nettie was a little puzzled.</p>

<p>The breakfast was as merry an affair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as the supper had been, and after it
was cleared away there was a consultation
upon what should be done next.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in thinking of church,&rdquo;
said Ben. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get there if we
tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there are so few trains I don&rsquo;t
suppose I can expect mother this morning,&rdquo;
said Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not expect her at all,&rdquo; replied
Ben, &ldquo;that is, not while the roads are so
snowy. There is scarcely any use in even
a sleigh while these drifts are so high.
Ande, what is the use of a sleigh, anyhow?&rdquo;
he asked, turning to his cousin
who saw a joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snow use&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll
go out and feed the hens, and then I&rsquo;ll
put on my boots and start on the road
again. I&rsquo;ll see what&rsquo;s going on at the
house, and then I&rsquo;ll come back again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&rdquo;
They watched him ploughing through
the snow, but because he had been there
and was coming back it seemed not lonely
at all, though Nettie said, wistfully, she
did hope her mother could come that day,
and Edna hoped she could find a way of
getting home.</p>

<p>Toward noon they saw a queer box-sleigh
coming from the main road. They
watched it interestedly from the window
as it approached nearer and nearer. &ldquo;I
do believe it is mother,&rdquo; exclaimed Nettie,
joyfully. And sure enough the sleigh did
stop before the door, a man got out,
and then helped a slight woman in black
to alight. &ldquo;It is mother,&rdquo; cried Nettie,
running to the door, and presently she
was in her mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>Then there were great explanations.
Like the little girls, Mrs. Black had been
snowed in, for her sister lived quite a
distance from the station, but she had at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
last been able to get some one of the
neighbors to bring her across, as he had
to go to the doctor&rsquo;s, and was willing to
take her the short distance further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had known how well cared for
you would be,&rdquo; she told her daughter,
&ldquo;and that you were not alone at all, I
should have been much less anxious.
Certainly, we have a great deal to be
thankful for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna felt that she certainly had a great
deal to be thankful for when a little later
she saw a big black sleigh stop before the
door. She recognized it as Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s,
for it was driven by her coach-man,
though in it sat Cousin Ben. He
had come back as he promised, but
in great state. And because Nettie&rsquo;s
mother had returned he bore Edna off
alone, after many good-bys and promises
to see her new friend as often as she
could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to come in Mrs.
MacDonald&rsquo;s sleigh?&rdquo; she asked her
cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will tell you. When I reached
the house I found that Mrs. MacDonald
had telephoned over to ask about all of
you, and to see how Celia was. When
she heard where you were and all about
it, she said she would send over her sleigh
and I could go for you and Nettie in it,
and so as that seemed a good arrangement
I was going to put it into execution.
We had decided to leave a note for Mrs.
Black in case she should get back to-day,
so she wouldn&rsquo;t be worried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really much better this way,&rdquo; returned
Edna, &ldquo;for now she has her
mother, and I will have mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed a delightful home coming, and
because the snow was still so deep there
was the extra holiday on Monday, but by
Tuesday all started off to school again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Mrs. MacDonald knew all about Mrs.
Black, and said she was a very good
woman, who had taken this little house in
the country because she could live there
more cheaply, and because in such a place
as she could afford in the city her little
daughter would not be surrounded by
pleasant influences. Nettie went to the
district school, and was such a little girl
as Edna&rsquo;s parents would select as a companion
for their daughter. So, Edna felt
she had made quite a discovery, and
planned all sorts of times with Nettie
when the winter was over.</p>

<p>Matters went on at school uninterruptedly,
until just before Christmas,
when it was suddenly made known that
Miss Ashurst was to be married, and that
another teacher would take her place
after the holidays. The G. R.&rsquo;s got up a
linen shower for the departing teacher,
but the Neighborhood Club did nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Its numbers were dwindling, for when
it was learned what good times the rivals
had at their meetings, there was more
than one deserter. For some reason,
Clara Adams had picked out Edna as the
prime cause of all this. She had never
forgiven her for winning the doll at the
fair the year before, and was likewise
furiously jealous of her friendship for
Jennie Ramsey. If Edna had been a less
generous and sweet-tempered child, matters
might have been much worse, but
even as it was they were made bad
enough.</p>

<p>No sooner had the new teacher appeared
than Clara set to work to do
everything in her power to make Edna
appear to disadvantage, by all sorts of
mean innuendoes, by sly hints, by even
open charges, till the child was almost in
tears over the state of affairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would just tell Miss Newman, so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
would,&rdquo; said Dorothy indignantly, when
a specially mean speech of Clara&rsquo;s came
to her ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I couldn&rsquo;t be a tattle-tale,&rdquo;
declared Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d better not say anything about
you to me,&rdquo; returned Dorothy. &ldquo;She
knows better than that. I&rsquo;d tell her a
thing or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Uncle Justus knew, he would believe
me and not Clara,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t cheat in my lessons, and he knows
I don&rsquo;t, whatever Clara may say, and
I&rsquo;m not the one who sets the girls up to
mischief, you know I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know mighty well who it is,&rdquo; declared
Dorothy, &ldquo;and if this keeps up I
shall tell, so I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did keep up till one morning the climax
was reached when Miss Newman
came into her school-room to find on the
board a very good caricature of herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
with under it written: &ldquo;Ugly, old Miss
New,&rdquo; in scrawling letters. Clara came
into the school-room late, and slipped into
her seat after the exercises had begun.
Miss Newman left the drawing on the
board and made no reference to it, using
a smaller board for what was necessary.
She was far less attractive than Miss
Ashurst, and had a dry little way with
her, which many of the girls thought oldmaidish,
but she was a good teacher, if
not a very beautiful one. When the girls
returned from recess, in place of Miss
Newman at the desk stood Mr. Horner,
his eyes fairly snapping with indignation,
and his eyebrows looking fiercer than
ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; whispered Dorothy, as she sank
down into her seat by Edna&rsquo;s side. The
rest of the girls looked pale and awe-stricken.
Never before had they any
recollection of Mr. Horner&rsquo;s coming into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the room. Offenders were sometimes
sent to him in the larger room, but this
was a new experience.</p>

<p>There was complete silence, while Mr.
Horner looked from one to the other as
if he would search their very hearts.
Some of the girls returned his gaze pleadingly,
some dropped their heads, Clara
Adams, with a little smile of indifference,
began to play with her pencil. Mr.
Horner glared at her. &ldquo;Put that down!&rdquo;
he said, and she dropped it, though still
wearing her impertinent little smile. &ldquo;I
wish to know,&rdquo; said Mr. Horner, &ldquo;who
was the first to arrive in this room this
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was the last,&rdquo; spoke up Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not asked that,&rdquo; said Mr.
Horner, turning upon her.</p>

<p>After quite a silence, Margaret arose.
&ldquo;I think I was the first, Mr. Horner,&rdquo;
she said, and then sat down again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no one in the room when
you came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Horner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was this on the board?&rdquo; He
pointed to the drawing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Horner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Horner,&rdquo; then with a little
catch of her breath, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do such
a mean thing, not for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for anything, I think you mean,
Margaret,&rdquo; said Mr. Horner in gentler
tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for anything,&rdquo; repeated Margaret,
meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I shall have to ask each separately,
and I expect a truthful answer,&rdquo;
said Mr. Horner. He began putting the
question, going from one to the next till
every girl in the room had been questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might have been one of the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
girls,&rdquo; said Miss Newman, in an undertone
to him.</p>

<p>Clara caught the words, as she was
nearest. &ldquo;I should think it would be
very easy to know who did it,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;when there is only one of us girls who
stays in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Horner severely.</p>

<p>Clara was not daunted. &ldquo;I mean that
there is only one girl who can come into
the school-room before the others can get
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean my niece? I should as
soon think of suspecting Miss Newman
herself.&rdquo; He looked over at Edna with
a little reassuring smile. &ldquo;However,
as we do not seem to be making much
headway I shall take other means of finding
out who did this very unladylike and
unkind thing.&rdquo; Then he gave them such
a lecture as none of them forgot and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the G. R.&rsquo;s did not have their motto
brought home to them on that occasion
they never did. Then Mr. Horner
returned to his own school-room and
Miss Newman called one of the girls to
clean off the board.</p>

<p>Nothing further was said of the matter,
and Miss Newman went on as if it had
never happened; but one day the last
of the week, the girls were asked to
illustrate in pencil drawings a story from
their history lesson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Newman, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly
do it,&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
expect finished drawings,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;and you may even make them as humorous
as you choose, but I want some little
attempt, no matter how slight. Mr.
Horner has asked that you do your best,
and I shall expect you to hand in something
beside blank paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy and Edna both sighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Neither one had the slightest idea of
drawing and knew that their results
would be absurd, but they labored away
and finally with half deprecating, half
amused expressions showed their drawings
to one another. It was as much as
they could do to keep from laughing outright,
they were so very funny, but they
signed their names in the corner as Miss
Newman directed them to do, and handed
them in. Then, Miss Newman took
them into the next room. At the close
of school, she said, &ldquo;Mr. Horner wishes
Clara Adams to stay after school; he
wishes to see her about her drawing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara perked up and looked around
with a little smirk. So she was the prize
draughtsman, and she remained with a
perfectly good grace. However, it was
a very different looking Clara who was
led into the room the next morning by
Mr. Horner. Her eyes were swollen with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
crying and she wore a rebellious expression
when Mr. Horner announced,
&ldquo;Clara Adams wishes to make a public
acknowledgment of her part in the rudeness
directed against Miss Newman by
the drawing you all saw on the board,
and she will also make a public apology
both to her teacher and to my niece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clara murmured something unintelligible
and burst into tears. The only
words the girls could make out were &ldquo;I
did it.&rdquo; It was the most terrible thing
that had ever happened to any of them
and Edna felt so sorry for the culprit
that all resentment vanished altogether.
She forgot entirely that she was included
in the apology, if apology there was, and
all morning she cast the most sympathetic
looks across the room at Clara.</p>

<p>It came out later that the drawings
were the proof of the child&rsquo;s guilt, for
they were done in the same style as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
caricature and because they were so much
better than the rest it was evident that
only Clara could have made the figure on
the board. She had come very early,
had slipped upstairs before anyone else
and had gone out again to return later
and thus hoped to avoid any suspicion.
It happened, too, that Ellen saw her come
in and go out again and this of course
clinched the matter when she was brought
face to face with the Irish girl who did
not know her name but recognized the
hat and coat she wore.</p>

<p>The affair made a great impression
but somehow did not increase Miss Newman&rsquo;s
popularity, for the idea of the
drawings was hers and Clara could not
forgive her for the position into which
she had forced her, therefore she lost no
opportunity of making it as unpleasant
for her teacher as she could in the thousand
and one ways a sly and unprincipled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
girl can, and her little pin-pricks were
so annoying, that finally Dorothy and
Edna, who had not particularly cared
for the new teacher, began to stand up for
her and to do as many kind things as they
could. Perhaps the G. R. Club was
mainly responsible for this, but at all
events it made matters a little happier
for the teacher.</p>

<p>As for Clara, Dorothy set her face
against any sort of friendship with her,
but it was not within Edna&rsquo;s heart to be
unkind to anyone, and she made up her
mind that she would meet Clara half way
if ever the chance came.</p>

<p>Uncle Justus never mentioned the
affair of the caricature to her, but she
knew he had never the slightest belief
that she had done it and his open
approval of her before the whole class
was very much valued. She had won her
way into the hearts of most of the girls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and there were only two or three of
Clara&rsquo;s most adoring adherents who still
called her &ldquo;a pet&rdquo; and said she was at
the bottom of all Clara&rsquo;s trouble. This
seemed a very strange way to look at it,
but poor Clara was so blinded by jealousy
and rage that she saw nothing in
the right light. Edna wondered if she
would ever cease to dislike her, and
insisted to Dorothy that they ought to try
to persuade her to come into the club.
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if she could once
find out what doing to others really
means she maybe would get over all her
hatefulness. Mother thinks so, and I&rsquo;m
not going to give up being nice to her
if I get a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t catch me,&rdquo; returned
Dorothy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go with
such a horrid story-teller as she is. I
shouldn&rsquo;t think you would, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna said not a word, but still hoped.</p>

<p class="desc">THE FRIENDLESS FRIENDS</p>


<p>Margaret came to school in great
excitement one Monday morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to have a party,&rdquo; she said to Edna.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it at recess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea of Margaret&rsquo;s really having a
party was most interesting when Edna
remembered that it had been just a year
since she was adopted by Mrs. MacDonald.
She had improved very much
in this time, both in speech and manner,
and no happier child could be found than
she. To be sure she had everything to
make her happy, as Dorothy often said,
a beautiful home, a kind mother and
friends who took pains to make her forget
how forlorn she had once been. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was very grateful for all these things, and
rarely asked for anything more than was
offered to her, so that Mrs. MacDonald
was all the more ready to give her pleasures
which she did not ask for.</p>

<p>Jennie and Dorothy were admitted into
the little group which gathered to hear
about the party. &ldquo;Tell us all about it,
Margaret,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;Just begin at
the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;mother was
saying to me on Saturday evening, &lsquo;Margaret,
do you know it is almost a year
since you became my own little daughter?
Now I think we ought to celebrate the day
of your coming to your home. What
would you like to do?&rsquo; So I thought and
thought, and then I said, &lsquo;I never had a
party in all my life, would it be too much
to celebrate by having one?&rsquo; and she said,
&lsquo;Not at all, though I should first like to
know what girls you would like to invite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>&rsquo;
and I told her all the G. R. Club. &lsquo;Anyone
else?&rsquo; she asked, and I thought of
Nettie Black. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to have Nettie,&rsquo;
I said, and then I remembered how
lonely I used to be even at the Friendless,
and how glad I used to be when you came
to see me, Edna, and I thought of two or
three who were still there, girls who
haven&rsquo;t been adopted, and I said I&rsquo;d like
to have them. Then mother said, &lsquo;Very
well, only the others may not want to
come if you have poor children like them,
and you&rsquo;d better ask the girls, and if they
refuse you can make up your mind which
you would rather have, the girls of the
club or the Friendlessers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Margaret, you know we won&rsquo;t
care,&rdquo; said Edna earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t, but I didn&rsquo;t
know about them all. I shall have to
ask, you see, because it seems to me that
of all the people I know, the Friendless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>ers
are the very ones who ought to come
when it is to celebrate my coming away
from there, and then, too they don&rsquo;t have
good times like we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls all called the Home of the
Friendless &ldquo;The Friendless&rdquo; and the
children there, &ldquo;The Friendlessers&rdquo; so
they knew quite well whom Margaret
meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon is the party to be?&rdquo; asked
Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next Saturday afternoon. The
Friendlessers can come then better than
any other time, and besides we live out of
town, and it will be easier for everyone
to come in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall come,&rdquo; said Dorothy decidedly,
&ldquo;and I think it is a beautiful idea
for you to have the Friendlessers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of course I shall come,&rdquo; put in
Jennie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know my sister will,&rdquo; said Edna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; echoed Dorothy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one thing I hope you won&rsquo;t
mind my saying,&rdquo; said Margaret;
&ldquo;mother says please not to wear party
frocks, and not to dress up much, on account
of the Friendlessers, you know, for
of course they won&rsquo;t have any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed the girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother says we can have just as good
a time if we are not dressed up and as
long as it is going to be in the daytime it
won&rsquo;t make so much difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go tell the other girls,&rdquo; suggested
Edna.</p>

<p>They hunted up Agnes, Celia and the
rest of the club members and did not find
one who objected to the presence of the
&ldquo;Friendlessers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, when the news of Margaret&rsquo;s
party was noised abroad, there was much
scorn on the part of the Neighborhood
Club. &ldquo;The idea,&rdquo; said Clara, &ldquo;of going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to a party with orphan asylum children!
I&rsquo;d like to see my mother allowing me to
associate with such creatures. I can&rsquo;t
think what Jennie Ramsey&rsquo;s mother can
be thinking of to allow her to go. Besides,
Margaret is an orphan asylum girl
herself and no better than the rest! I&rsquo;m
sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen at her party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re not even going to wear
party frocks, nor so much as white ones,&rdquo;
said Gertrude Crane. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what
fun it will be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose there are to be no
boys,&rdquo; put in Clara.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard whether there are to
be or not,&rdquo; returned Gertrude.</p>

<p>The question of boys did come up later
when Mrs. MacDonald asked Margaret if
she did not think it would be well to invite
Frank and Charley Conway, as one of
the &ldquo;Friendlessers&rdquo; was a boy. The two
Porter boys who came out often to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
with the Conway boys, were thought of
and were invited, and when Edna
returned home on Friday evening Cousin
Ben informed her that he, too, was going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Cousin Ben,&rdquo; she said in
pleased surprise, &ldquo;how does that happen,
when you are such a big boy, really a
man, you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must confess I fished for an invitation,&rdquo;
he told her. &ldquo;Mrs. MacDonald
was over here to ask if Charlie and Frank
could come and I said, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with asking me, too?&rsquo; and so I got
my invite. I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it for a six-pence.&rdquo;
Cousin Ben and Mrs. MacDonald
were great friends and he was
quite intimate at the big gray house so it
was no wonder that he wanted to be at
Margaret&rsquo;s first party.</p>

<p>It was as Ben said &ldquo;a queer mix-up.&rdquo;
The first to arrive were the four children
from the Home of the Friendless, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
little girls and one little boy. One of the
teachers brought them out and remained
in order to take them back again. The
big gray house looked cheerful and more
attractive than usual, for flowers were
Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s great pleasure and
they were everywhere, making up for the
plainness of the furnishings, for Mrs.
MacDonald did not believe in showiness.
Her house was thoroughly comfortable
but not elegant.</p>

<p>These first arrivals were very shy, quite
awe-stricken and sat on the edges of their
chairs scarce daring to move until Margaret
took them out to see the greenhouses.
After that they were a little
more at their ease for each came back
with a flower. By a little after three all
had arrived, the Porter boys with their
Punch and Judy show which they had
promised to bring, and Ben with his
banjo. All the girls wore plain frocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with no extra ornaments, Margaret herself
being not much better dressed than
her friends from the Home.</p>

<p>The Punch and Judy show was given
first as a sort of prelude to the games
which were to follow, and in these even
the older girls joined with spirit. The
main idea seemed to be that everyone
should do his or her best to make the
party a success and to give the poorer
children as good a time as possible.
Ben, be it said, was the life of the occasion.
He kept everyone going, never
allowed a dull moment, and if nothing
else was planned, he would pick up his
banjo and give a funny coon song, so that
it was no wonder Mrs. MacDonald was
glad to have invited him.</p>

<p>Probably in all their lives the Friendlessers
never forgot the wonderful table
to which they were led when refreshments
were served, and which they talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
of for weeks afterward. Here there was
no stint and the decorations were made
as beautiful as possible. There were
pretty little favors for everyone, and
such good things to eat as would have
done credit to any entertainment. It was
all over at six o&rsquo;clock, but not one went
away with a feeling of having had a
stupid time, for even the older girls
agreed among themselves that it had
been great fun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like those
children&rsquo;s eyes when they saw that
table,&rdquo; said Agnes smiling at the recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been like a fairy tale
to them, poor little things,&rdquo; replied Helen
Darby. &ldquo;I think it was a perfectly
lovely thing for Mrs. MacDonald to do.
Won&rsquo;t I have fun telling father about
it, and how interested he will be. He has
been quizzing me all day about my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
orphan asylum party, but I know he
liked my going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked that little Nettie Black,&rdquo;
Florence remarked. &ldquo;She has such a
nice quaint little face, like an old-fashioned
picture. Her name ought to be
Prudence or Charity or some of those
queer old names. Where did you pick
her up, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she is the little girl that I kept
house with at the time of the blizzard,&rdquo;
Edna told her. &ldquo;She lives just a short
way up the side road, and she is a very
nice child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found that out,&rdquo; returned Florence.
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she belong to our club?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she doesn&rsquo;t go to our school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, I forgot that. Well, she
could be made an honorary member or
something, couldn&rsquo;t she Agnes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I should think so. We&rsquo;ll have
to bring that up at our next meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Would she like to belong to the club, do
you think, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would just love to, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to fix it some way.
I&rsquo;ll ask mother or Mrs. Conway what we
can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how we could all get into
their parlor,&rdquo; said Edna doubtfully; &ldquo;it
is so very tiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Agnes told her,
&ldquo;for you know the general club-room is
up in our attic and I&rsquo;m sure that is big
enough for anyone. If Nettie comes into
the club, when her turn comes for a meeting
it can be held in the general club-room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was very satisfactory, but it did
not do away with another difficulty which
came to Edna&rsquo;s mind. She knew that
Mrs. Black had barely enough means to
get along on with the utmost economy and
how Nettie could ever furnish even simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
refreshments for a dozen or more girls
she did not know. However, she would
not worry about that till the time came.
As yet Nettie was not even a member of
the club.</p>

<p>Margaret&rsquo;s party was talked about at
school almost as much after as before it
came off. Those who had been present
discoursed upon the good time they had
had, and those who were not there wished
they had been. But to offset it, there came
the report that Clara Adams was going to
have a party and that it would be in the
evening and was expected to be a
gorgeous affair. Jennie Ramsey was
invited but had not made up her mind
whether she wanted to go or not. As
most of those who would be invited were
the children of Mrs. Adams&rsquo;s friends and
were not schoolmates of Clara&rsquo;s it did not
seem to Jennie that she would have a
very good time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be all fuss and feathers,&rdquo; she
told Dorothy and Edna, &ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t
know half the children there, besides I
shall hear so much talk about what I shall
wear and all that, I believe I&rsquo;d rather
stay at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clara is going to wear a lace frock
over pink silk, I heard her say,&rdquo; Dorothy
told them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think that would be very
pretty,&rdquo; declared Edna admiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be dressed as we were at
Margaret&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Jennie returned, &ldquo;for then
we could romp around and not care
anything about what happened to our
clothes.&rdquo; Jennie hadn&rsquo;t a spark of
vanity and cared so little for dress as to
be a surprise to the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course that was nice, but I should
like the pretty clothes, too,&rdquo; rejoined
Edna with honesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t do anything, either, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
dance and sit around and look at each
other,&rdquo; continued Jennie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much
rather play games like &lsquo;Going to Jerusalem&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Forfeits&rsquo; and all those things
we did at Margaret&rsquo;s. I have all the
dancing I want at dancing-school. No, I
shall tell my mother I don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;
Jennie had made up her mind, and that
was the end of the matter for her.</p>

<p>Therefore the others heard very little
of what went on at Clara&rsquo;s party. That
it came off they knew, and there was
much talk of what this one or that one
wore, of how late they stayed and how
many dances they had, but that was all,
and the stay-at-homes decided that, after
all they had not missed much, and if
Clara&rsquo;s intention was to rouse their envy
she failed of her purpose.</p>

<p>At the next meeting of the club Nettie
was voted in as an honorary member.
&ldquo;That seems to be about the only thing we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
can do,&rdquo; Agnes announced, &ldquo;and everyone
seems to want her.&rdquo; So the thing
was done.</p>

<p>If there was one thing above another
which Nettie did long for it was to become
a member of the club whose wonderful
doings she had heard so much of from
Edna. The two had seen each other
often, and now that the spring was nearing,
rarely a Saturday came but that they
met. It was Edna who took her the joyful
news on Friday evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something perfectly lovely to
tell you,&rdquo; she announced as soon as she
was inside the door of the little house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Nettie with a quick
smile of interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be a member of our
club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edna, how can I be? I don&rsquo;t
go to your school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, and that is why we had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
make you an <a name="tn161" id="tn161"></a><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'honorary member, Agnes said.&rdquo;'">honorary member,&rdquo; Agnes
said.</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think you are all the dearest
things I ever knew,&rdquo; cried Nettie. Then
her face fell, &ldquo;But, oh, Edna, how can we
get all of you girls in this little bit of a
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can meet in the general club-room
at the Evanses,&rdquo; Edna told her.
&ldquo;Agnes says so and it is in their attic, you
know. When a girl can&rsquo;t very well have
the meeting at her house we have it there.
Once it was to be at Betty Lowndes&rsquo;s
house and her little sister had the chicken-pox
so we couldn&rsquo;t meet there and we had
it in the attic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie&rsquo;s face cleared, but presently a
new difficulty presented itself, one which
she hesitated to speak of but which was
a very serious one. How should she tell
Edna what was in her mind? But she
remembered that Edna had seen the pov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>erty
of the family stores and that there
was no need to make any pretence to her.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t any money, and I couldn&rsquo;t ask
mother for refreshments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; answered Edna;
&ldquo;we might give them rice,&rdquo; and then they
both laughed. &ldquo;If there were only some
way you could earn some money and I
could help you,&rdquo; continued Edna with
more seriousness. &ldquo;Perhaps we could
think of some way. If it were something
we could both do, I could help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always so good that way,&rdquo;
replied Nettie gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow,&rdquo; said Edna, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t
be for some time yet that you have to have
the meeting and perhaps we can think of
something. If we can&rsquo;t would you mind
if I ask mother what we could do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; replied Nettie doubtfully,
&ldquo;not unless you have to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t unless I have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps my mother can think of a
way, only I don&rsquo;t want to say anything
to her, for she will feel badly because she
can&rsquo;t let me have the money, and I know
I ought not to ask her for it. I won&rsquo;t
ask, of course, but if I tell it will be the
same as asking, and it will make her feel
so unhappy if she must say no, she can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must try very hard to think
of a way without telling anyone. You
wouldn&rsquo;t need so very much, you know,
Nettie, for we can have real cheap things
like peanuts and gingerbread, or something
like that. I believe fifty cents
would be enough to spend, and a dollar
would be plenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed like a large amount to
Nettie, though she did not say so, and the
thought of earning that much weighed
heavily upon her after Edna had gone
home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Edna&rsquo;s thoughts, too, were busy all the
evening, and she was so absorbed in Nettie&rsquo;s
dilemma that she sat with arms on
the table and doing nothing but looking
off into space so that at last her father
said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, little girl?
You haven&rsquo;t even asked for your favorite
children&rsquo;s page of my evening paper,&rdquo;
and he handed it over to her.</p>

<p>This was something that Edna always
asked for and she took it now with some
little interest, and roused herself to
look down the columns. Presently she
breathed softly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She had seen
something which gave her an idea for
Nettie, and she went to bed that night full
of a hope which she meant her friend
should know as soon as possible the next
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="desc">THE PUZZLE</p>


<p>When Edna awoke on Saturday morning
her first thought was of Nettie and
she scrambled out of bed that she might
not lose a moment&rsquo;s time in telling her of
the discovery she had made the night before.
She hurried through her breakfast
and was off to the little house as soon as
she had been given leave by her mother.
She carried the page of her father&rsquo;s paper
safely folded in her hand, and ran nearly
all the way, arriving breathless. She
could scarcely wait for Nettie to open to
her knock, and her words tumbled over
each other as she replied to Nettie&rsquo;s greeting
of &ldquo;How nice and early you are,&rdquo; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
saying, &ldquo;Oh, I have something so nice to
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had something nice to tell me
when you came last evening,&rdquo; returned
Nettie; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say there is
anything more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve found a way that maybe you
can make some money, a dollar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was exciting, &ldquo;Oh, do tell me
quick,&rdquo; returned Nettie.</p>

<p>Edna hastily began to open the paper
she carried, and then she thrust it before
Nettie, pointing to a line and saying,
&ldquo;There, read that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie did as she was told, her eyes
eagerly running over the words. &ldquo;Oh,
Edna,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you believe we could
do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, but you see the main
thing is to get it done as quickly as possible,
for the one who gets the answer to
the puzzle the quickest and who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the clearest answer will get the first prize.
Maybe we couldn&rsquo;t get the very first, but
we could get the second, and that&rsquo;s a dollar.
We must set to work right away.
I thought we&rsquo;d do the best we could and
then we&rsquo;d get Cousin Ben to fix it up for
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that be right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think so, for it doesn&rsquo;t say you
mustn&rsquo;t have any help; it just says the
one who sends it in the soonest. I left a
note for Cousin Ben to stop here if he had
<a name="tn167" id="tn167"></a>time <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: missing closing bracket in the original text">this morning.&rdquo;</ins></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he has time. I told him it was
something very particular. You don&rsquo;t
mind his knowing, do you, Nettie? He
won&rsquo;t tell, I am sure. You don&rsquo;t know
how well he can keep a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Nettie replied,
&ldquo;because he has been here and knows all
about everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must finish the dishes first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then would you rather I should help
you with them or start on the puzzle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better start on the puzzle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a little
about it, and I believe I&rsquo;ve guessed part.
They are in the paper every week on Fridays,
and I often do them, but this is the
first time I&rsquo;ve noticed that a prize has
been offered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took off her coat and hat, sat down
at the table and spread out the paper before
her. Nettie furnished paper and
pencil and then went back to her work in
the kitchen. The two were busying their
brains over the puzzle when Ben appeared
an hour later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s up, kiddies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you see,&rdquo; Edna began, &ldquo;Nettie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
has been taken into the club, and when her
time comes to have the club meeting she
won&rsquo;t have any way of getting the refreshments,
so we thought and thought of
what we could do to get some money, and
last night I saw in the Children&rsquo;s Corner
of the <i>Times</i> that they would give prizes
for guessing a puzzle, you know those
puzzles, Cousin Ben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my child, I knew them of yore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you see if we can only
guess this one quick and can send in the
answer right away we might get a dollar,
anyhow. We have guessed a lot of it, but
I thought maybe you could help us a little
and tell us how to fix it up very nicely.
Have you very much to do to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so much but that I can spare you
a little time for such laudable ambition.
Where&rsquo;s your puzzle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna produced the paper and then
showed him what they had already done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do you think it is right as far as we&rsquo;ve
gone?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>He looked over the page she offered
him. &ldquo;Pretty good so far. Let me see.
I think that must be John B. J on B.
you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, it is, why didn&rsquo;t we think
of that? And this one, what do you think
that can be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben looked at this thoughtfully, and
presently declared he had it. So bit by
bit the puzzle was completed and within
an hour was in such shape as pleased the
girls immensely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
can do. I want to take the noon train to
town and I&rsquo;ll get this right down to the
newspaper office myself; I have to go near
there, and so it will reach them much
quicker than if it were sent by mail, you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Ben, you are a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
dear!&rdquo; cried Edna. &ldquo;I think that is just
lovely of you. We are so much obliged,
aren&rsquo;t we, Nettie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to both of
you,&rdquo; returned Nettie sedately. Edna&rsquo;s
interest was so great that she forgot she
was not doing this for herself at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we tell your mother?&rdquo; asked
Edna when Ben had gone, promising that
he would attend to the puzzle the very
first thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; Nettie hesitated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to have her know and yet I would love
dearly to have it for a surprise if we did
win. When do you suppose we will
know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before next Friday, I suppose, but
that will be soon enough, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, except that I can scarcely wait
to know, and it is hard to keep a secret
from your mother that long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell her that you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
a secret and that you can&rsquo;t tell her till
Friday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might do that, but then suppose I
shouldn&rsquo;t win; we would both be disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you tell her just now that
we were all doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her we were doing a puzzle, and
she said as long as I had done my morning&rsquo;s
work I could stay with you. I have
still my stockings to darn, but I can do
those this afternoon. Mother always lets
me do them when I choose; so long as I
get them done before Sunday, that is all
she asks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna looked very sympathetic. She
did not have to do her stockings nowadays,
though she remembered that it had been
one of the week&rsquo;s tasks when she was
staying with Aunt Elizabeth, and it was
one she much disliked. She stayed a little
while longer and then returned home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
for Dorothy was coming that afternoon
and they were both going over to see Margaret
to make what Dorothy said was
their party call.</p>

<p>The weather was quite mild; already
the buds were beginning to swell on the
trees, and the crocuses were starting up
in the little grass plot in front of Nettie&rsquo;s
home. Edna stopped to look at them
as she passed out. She was full of Nettie&rsquo;s
secret but she had promised not to
tell. She wished Cousin Ben would come
back so she could talk it over with him,
but he was not to return till late in the
day and meantime she must occupy herself
and not say a word of what was uppermost
in her mind.</p>

<p>She found Celia and Agnes in the library
talking earnestly. There was a
pleasant aroma of gingerbread pervading
the house, and the fire in the open grate
looked very cheerful. What a dear place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
home was, and how glad she was always
to get back to it. Agnes held out her
hand as she came in. &ldquo;Well, chickabiddy,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;where have you been?
You are as rosy as an apple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been down to Nettie&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m glad
I don&rsquo;t have to darn my stockings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Nettie have to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she has to wash the dishes,
too. I did darn my stockings last year,
but Katie does them all this year, so I
don&rsquo;t even have to be sorry for mother
and think of her doing them, for Katie is
paid to do them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agnes laughed. &ldquo;But I have no doubt
you would do them just as cheerfully as
Nettie does, if you had to do them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the cheerful part,
but I wouldn&rsquo;t yell and scream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us hope you would not,&rdquo; said Celia.
&ldquo;I should hope you knew better
than to behave like that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;What were
you talking about, you two?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we tell her, Agnes?&rdquo; asked Celia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? It will soon be talked over
by all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we were talking of having something
very special for the last meeting of
the club, after school closes. You see
most of the girls go away for the summer,
and we shall have to give the club
a holiday, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nice special thing were you
thinking of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought if we could have some
nice little fairy play and have it out of
doors, it would be lovely. We would invite
our parents and the teachers and
have a real big affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How perfectly lovely. What is the
play?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, we haven&rsquo;t come to that yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
We did think some of having &lsquo;Alice in
Wonderland,&rsquo; but that has been done so
often. We were wishing for something
original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get Cousin Ben to help
you? He has so many funny things to
say about the woodsy creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very one. Why didn&rsquo;t we think
of him before, Agnes? He may be silly
about some things, but he would certainly
have ideas about that. Where is he,
Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has gone in town, and won&rsquo;t be
back till late in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust you for keeping track of his
movements,&rdquo; said Celia laughing. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe Ben yawns but Edna knows
it. Well, we will see what he says this
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you and he come to our house
after supper?&rdquo; asked Agnes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out and &rsquo;phone you when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
comes in. He doesn&rsquo;t generally have
anything special on hand Saturdays, unless
something is going on at the Abercrombies&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gave Edna a new theme to think of
and in consequence she did not find it hard
to keep from talking of Nettie&rsquo;s secret
when she and Dorothy met that afternoon.</p>

<p>They took the news of the probable
play to Margaret who wanted at once to
tell Mrs. MacDonald about it. She
showed great interest and asked all sorts
of questions. &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you have it
here in my grounds?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;There
is a good place just back of the house
where the terrace is. I hope you will let
it be Margaret&rsquo;s meeting and let me
furnish everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Mac, there will be ever and
ever so many people, for we are going to
ask our families and the teachers and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
those.&rdquo; Edna was quite overpowered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what of that? Haven&rsquo;t I as
much right to entertain them as any of
the others have, and have I less room than
my neighbors?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no, you have more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. I put in my plea
the first one and I hope you will lay it before
your next meeting.&rdquo; She spoke almost
as if she were angry but there was a
merry little twinkle in her eyes which
the girls had come to know well. The
next words were, &ldquo;Go out, Margaret, and
ask Lizzie to send in some of the day&rsquo;s
baking for your friends. There must be
scones, or something of that kind.&rdquo; The
girls liked the Scotchy things, as they
called them, that Mrs. MacDonald had for
them, and the hot scones, with a &ldquo;wee
bittie&rdquo; of honey or jam were generally
as pleasant a treat as they found anywhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>When Edna had returned from her
visit she told Celia of what Mrs. MacDonald
had offered and before they had
finished talking of it, Cousin Ben came in,
and was immediately set upon, though
Edna ran out to meet him in the hall that
she might whisper, &ldquo;Did you leave it all
right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First thing,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;It
couldn&rsquo;t have been an hour from the time
I left you before it was at the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goody, goody!&rdquo; exclaimed Edna
softly, patting her hands together.
&ldquo;Agnes has been here, Cousin Ben, and
Celia wants to ask you something. Come
into the library, please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He followed her in and the subject was
opened to him of the little fairy play.</p>

<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t promise.
That&rsquo;s a good deal to spring on a fellow
unbeknownst. I&rsquo;ll have to think about
it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t you go over to Agnes&rsquo;s this
evening to talk it over?&rdquo; asked Celia.</p>

<p>Now Ben admired Agnes very much,
though he would not have it known for
the world. &ldquo;I was going to Abercrombies,&rdquo;
he said with apparent reluctance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you see Will Abercrombie
every day,&rdquo; said Celia coaxingly, &ldquo;and
we do so want to have your help, Ben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I can &rsquo;phone to Will not
to expect me,&rdquo; said Ben giving in. &ldquo;But
if I take hold of this thing you girls will
all have to do your part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we will,&rdquo; Celia promised earnestly.
&ldquo;We are none of us up to an
original play, but you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such flattery,&rdquo; laughed Ben. &ldquo;Well,
if I am going to call on ladies I must go
up and make myself look respectable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Celia, as soon as her
cousin had left the room. &ldquo;He has as
good as promised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever was said that evening was
not reported, but it is enough to say that
Ben had promised to see what he could
do, and would let them know later when
he had gone over the subject more thoroughly,
so with this the girls had to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>There was no more to be heard of either
puzzle or play during the week while
school was occupying them all, but on
Friday Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s offer was presented
to the club and unanimously accepted
with thanks.</p>

<p>There was no delay in Edna&rsquo;s demand
for the evening paper on that Friday, but
to her great disappointment her father
found that he had left it in the car, and
there was no way to get another copy till
the next day. Edna was almost in tears,
for she had so counted on letting Nettie
know the very first thing in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
forgot entirely that the Friday issue was
the one in which you are always so interested.
I will bring you out a copy to-morrow,
daughter. I will try not to
forget it, but I give you leave to call me
up on the long distance, or rather the out-of-town
line and get you to remind me.
If you will call, say, at about ten o&rsquo;clock,
I will send one of the boys out for it from
the office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was certainly more than Edna had
any right to expect, and she thanked him
as heartily as she could, though deep down
in her heart the disappointment still
lingered and she felt that it would be
harder still for Nettie to wait another day.</p>

<p>However, she went early to the little
house as she had promised, and saw Nettie
at the window on the watch for her. She
looked so pleased when she saw her friend
that Edna was all the more grieved at
having to tell her she must wait till even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>ing.
&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad you have come,&rdquo;
cried Nettie as she met her at the door.
&ldquo;I have been watching for you for ages.&rdquo;
And she drew her inside.</p>



<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="desc">A DOWNFALL OF PRIDE</p>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edna, Edna!&rdquo; Nettie jumped up
and down and fairly hugged her friend in
her joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, why,&rdquo; Edna began, but Nettie
interrupted her with &ldquo;I have it! I have
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have what?&rdquo; Edna was still mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The prize! The prize! I won it.
The money came in the mail this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna had not counted on this possibility
and it was as much of a surprise
to her as it had been to Nettie. &ldquo;Oh!
Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she cried, and she, too, began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to dance up and down hugging Nettie as
fervently as Nettie had hugged her.
&ldquo;Have you told your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do show me what they said.&rdquo; So
Nettie took her in and showed her the
precious letter with the enclosed order for
a dollar, which made it seem a very real
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben will be so pleased,&rdquo; said Edna
with satisfaction. &ldquo;It is really owing to
him that it got there soon enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to you for helping me and for
telling me in the first place. I think I
ought to divide with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nettie Black, you won&rsquo;t do any
such thing. Don&rsquo;t you know that it was
all on your account that we did it in the
first place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye-es, but after your doing so much it
doesn&rsquo;t seem fair for you to have none of
it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some of the refreshments,
won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie laughed. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you decided what you will
have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. I thought I would wait
till you came to talk it over with mother.
You said something about gingerbread
and my mother can make the nicest you
ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would she make some for you? I
wonder if it would cost very much. None
of the girls have had gingerbread, and I
am sure it would be liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s go see what mother says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Black was in the kitchen making
bread for her Saturday baking. She
smiled on the two children&rsquo;s eager faces
which showed that something of unusual
interest was going on. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; began
Nettie, &ldquo;you know I am to have the club
meeting after a while, and it is to be at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
general club-room at Miss Agnes Evans&rsquo;s
house, and you know we always have refreshments,&rdquo;
Nettie spoke as if she had
already attended every meeting, when that
of the afternoon before had been her very
first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember you told me, dear,&rdquo;
said her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I told you that was why we tried
for the puzzle prize, so that I could pay
for my refreshments. Does gingerbread
cost very much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, it costs less than any
other kind of cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how much? I mean how much
would it cost to make enough for&mdash;for
fourteen girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, not a great deal. I could bake
them in the little scalloped pans so they
would be more crusty. I don&rsquo;t believe it
would cost more than twenty-five cents,
for you know we have our own eggs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Then what else could I have?
We can&rsquo;t have more than three things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me think for a minute and I will
perhaps be able to suggest something.&rdquo;
She went on kneading her bread while
the children watched her. Presently she
said: &ldquo;I have a bottle of raspberry shrub
that your Aunt Henrietta gave me and
which we have never used. Would you
like to have that? I can recommend it as
a very nice drink, and I should be very
glad to donate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it be nice?&rdquo; Nettie looked at
Edna for endorsement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be perfectly delicious,&rdquo;
she decided, &ldquo;and nobody has had
anything like that. We have had ginger
ale and lemonade, and chocolate and such
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, mother, that will be very nice,
thank you,&rdquo; said Nettie, as if Edna were
at the other end of a telephone wire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now for number three. I shall have
ever so much to spend on that, so I could
have most anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have the other girls had?&rdquo; Mrs.
Black asked Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, different things. Some have had
sandwiches and chocolate and some kind
of candy, and some have had ice cream
and cake and candy; some have had&mdash;let
me see&mdash;cake and lemonade and fruit, but
the third thing is generally some kind of
candy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember what Uncle David
sent us last week?&rdquo; Mrs. Black asked
Nettie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The maple sugar? Oh, yes, but would
it be nice to have just little chunks of
maple sugar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but don&rsquo;t you know what delicious
creamy candies we made by boiling and
stirring it? Why not do some of it that
way? It would be a little out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
usual run, and quite unlike what is bought
at the shops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Edna?&rdquo; Nettie
again appealed to her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be fine. Oh, Nettie
you will have things that aren&rsquo;t a bit like
anyone else has had and they will all be
so good. I am sure the girls will say
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie beamed. This was such a pleasant
thing to hear. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t spent
but twenty-five cents of my prize money,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you so very sorry for that?&rdquo; her
mother asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;Is it all mine, mother, to
do what I choose with, even if I don&rsquo;t
spend it for the club?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, my dear. You earned
it, and if I am able to help you out a little
that should make no difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I think I know what I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
like to do with it. I shall make two
secrets of it and one I shall tell you,
mother, and the other I can tell Edna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me mine now,&rdquo; said Edna getting
down from the chair.</p>

<p>Nettie took her off into the next room
where there was much whispering for the
next few minutes. &ldquo;I shall get something
for mother,&rdquo; Nettie explained. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know exactly what but I will find out what
she needs the most.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that is a perfectly lovely
plan,&rdquo; agreed Edna. &ldquo;Now I must go
back and tell Ben, for he will want to
know. You come up this afternoon, Nettie,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nettie promised, and after Edna had
gone she said to her mother, &ldquo;Mother, I
think I will spend part of my money on a
birthday gift for Edna. It was all her
doings about the puzzle and I would like
to have her have something I could buy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
with the money. Will you help me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will, my dear, and I think
that is an excellent plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Nettie had her two secrets and in
time both gifts were given.</p>

<p>Her meeting was an interesting one.
The girls always liked the old attic and it
was seldom that a meeting there did not
turn out to be one which was thoroughly
enjoyed. The refreshments received even
more praise than Edna had predicted, for
not a crumb of gingerbread, not a single
maple-sugar cream, nor a drop of raspberry
shrub was left, and the honorary
member went home in an exalted frame of
mind.</p>

<p>On the very evening of this meeting,
while Edna was looking over her favorite
page of her father&rsquo;s paper, she heard him
say to his wife. &ldquo;Humph. That was a
bad failure of Green and Adams to-day.
Adams was a pretty high-flyer, and a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
many of the men on the &rsquo;Change have
been prophesying this crash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Adams is that?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Conway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oliver Adams. He lives on the
square, you know, in that large white
house with the lions in front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna pricked up her ears. &ldquo;Is it
Clara Adams&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she live on the square?&rdquo; asked
her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a big white house with lions in
front just like father said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, it is the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened to him, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has lost a great deal of money,
dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor Clara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she will be poor Clara sure
enough,&rdquo; returned her father. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t
keep up that way of living very long.
His wife is as extravagant as he is, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
I doubt if there is much left out of the
estate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna wondered if Clara would have to
live in a tiny, little house like Nettie&rsquo;s
and if she would be very unhappy.
Would she leave school, and&mdash;There
were so many wonderings that she asked
her mother a great many questions, and
went off on Monday morning feeling quite
ready to give Clara all the sympathy she
needed.</p>

<p>But Clara was not at school on Monday,
but on the next day she appeared. The
news of her father&rsquo;s failure was common
talk so that every girl in school had heard
of it, and wondered if it would have any
effect on Clara. For a time it did not,
but in a short time it was whispered about
that the Adamses had removed to another
street and into a much smaller house.
Clara no longer came to school in the
automobile, and those girls who had clung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to her on account of the powers of riches
now openly deserted, declared that she
had left their neighborhood and in consequence
could no longer belong to their
club. Then in a little while it was announced
that the club had disbanded, and
the remaining members came in a body
and begged that they might be taken into
the G. R.&rsquo;s. There was much discussion.
Some were for, some were against it, but
finally the rule of the club was acted upon
and the five new members took their
places, leaving Clara in lonely grandeur.
She treated this desertion with such open
scorn and was so very unpleasant to those
who had formerly been her friends, that
they turned their backs upon her utterly,
declaring that they would rather pay a
fine every day in the week than be nice
to Clara Adams.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hateful thing!&rdquo; Edna heard Nellie
Haskell say one day quite loud enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
for Clara to hear. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s kept us out of
a lot of fun and we were geese to keep
in with her so long. I&rsquo;m sorry I ever
had anything to do with her. I think she
is the most disagreeable girl that ever
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna looked over at Clara who was
sitting very still by herself on a bench in
one corner of the playground. She looked
after the three girls who had just passed
and were now walking down the path
with their arms around one another.
So had she seen them with Clara not so
very long before. She thought she would
go over and say something to her old
enemy, but what to say&mdash;She had no
good excuse. Then she remembered an
exceedingly pretty paper-doll which had
been sent her by her Cousin Louis Morrison.
His aunt had painted it and it was
much handsomer than one ordinarily
saw. Edna had it in the book she car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>ried.
She drew in her breath quickly,
then started over to Clara&rsquo;s corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to see my paper-doll?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;It is such a beauty.&rdquo; And
without waiting for an answer she
opened her book and held out the doll for
Clara to see. It was given rather a
grudging glance, but it was really too
pretty not to be admired and Clara replied
with a show of indifference, &ldquo;It is
quite pretty, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna sat down by her. &ldquo;I will show
you some of her dresses,&rdquo; she went on.
Clara loved paper-dolls, and she could not
but be a little interested. Anything which
was painted or drawn was of more interest
to her than most things. She had
shown her talent in that way by the fatal
caricature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody told me you could make
mighty pretty paper-dolls,&rdquo; Edna went
on, bound to make herself agreeable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do make them sometimes,&rdquo; replied
Clara a little more graciously, &ldquo;but I
could never make any as pretty as this.
I can copy things pretty well, but I can&rsquo;t
make them up myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Edna struggled with herself.
The doll was a new and very precious
possession, but&mdash;She hesitated
only a moment and then she said:
&ldquo;Would you like to copy this? I will
lend it to you if you would like to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a time when Clara might
have spurned even this kind offer, setting
it down as &ldquo;trying to get in&rdquo; with her,
but her pride and vanity had received a
blow when the Neighborhood Club was
broken up and she cast forth, and she took
the offer in the spirit in which it was
meant. &ldquo;Oh, would you do that?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I should love to copy it and I will
take awfully good care of the doll.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can take it now,&rdquo; said Edna lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>ing
the doll on the other&rsquo;s lap. There
should be no chance for her to change her
mind. Clara slipped the doll into one of
her books and just then the bell rang,
so they went in together.</p>

<p>After school Dorothy clutched her
chum. &ldquo;Edna Conway,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;did
I see you talking to Clara Adams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um-huh,&rdquo; returned Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are the greatest one. I
should think after all she has done that
you would want to keep as far away from
her as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Edna. &ldquo;I said I was going
to be nice to her if ever I had the
chance and I had the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are going with her, I can tell
you that all the girls will turn their backs
on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was going with her all
the time, but I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t speak
to her if I want to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose you can speak, but I
shouldn&rsquo;t do much more than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna made no reply. She had her own
ideas of what she meant to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your paper-doll?&rdquo; asked
Dorothy, &ldquo;I want to show it to Agnes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t it with me,&rdquo; returned Edna
a little confusedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had it when we went down to
recess. Is it in your desk? Go on and
get it, that is a dear. Agnes wants to see
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in my desk. I haven&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; returned
Edna bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have
given it away? Edna Conway, you can&rsquo;t
have given it to Clara Adams!&rdquo; Dorothy&rsquo;s
voice expressed horror and dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t <i>given</i> it to her; I only
lent it to her,&rdquo; replied Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; Dorothy was
stricken dumb for a moment. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
put her arms around her friend and
hugged her. &ldquo;You are an angel,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have done such a thing
to save me, and I don&rsquo;t believe there is
another girl in the school who could.
I&rsquo;m going to tell Agnes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; begged Edna.</p>

<p>But Dorothy was off and presently
Agnes came over to where the two had
been standing. &ldquo;What did you lend
Clara your doll for, Edna?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t want to pay a fine,&rdquo;
replied she.</p>

<p>Agnes laughed. &ldquo;That is one way out
of it. I suppose the next thing we know
you will be proposing that we ask Clara
Adams into our club. Half the girls will
leave if you do, I can promise you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was something very like a threat,
and it had the effect Agnes meant it
should, though it did not prevent Edna
from making plans of her own concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Clara. She smiled at her as she took her
seat in class the next morning, and for
the very first time in all her life she
received from Clara a smile in return.</p>

<p class="desc">A NEW MEMBER</p>


<p>During this time Miss Newman had not
won more than respect from her girls.
She was an excellent teacher and kept
good order, but she had too severe a manner
to call forth affection. Nevertheless
she did appreciate any little kindness
done her, and was not unwilling to repay
when the opportunity came. Dorothy
and Edna had always stood up for her,
and had brought her the small gifts which
children like to take their teachers, a particularly
large and rosy apple, a bunch
of flowers, a more important present at
Christmas and a growing plant at Easter.
They did not know much about her home
life, for she was not the affable person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Miss Ashurst had been. Uncle Justus
had told Edna that she lived with an
invalid sister in quite a different quarter
of the city, and that she had a long way
to come to school.</p>

<p>One spring afternoon as Celia and
Edna were starting forth, a sudden shower
overtook them. They were going home
every day now as they had done in the
early fall, and were hurrying for their
train when they saw Miss Newman just
ahead of them without an umbrella.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Miss Newman,&rdquo; said Edna to
her sister, &ldquo;and she has no umbrella; I&rsquo;m
going to give her mine and come under
yours, Celia,&rdquo; then before Celia could
say a word she ran on ahead. &ldquo;Please
take my umbrella, Miss Newman,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I can go under Celia&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you may need it before Monday,&rdquo;
said Miss Newman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I won&rsquo;t, for I am going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
straight home. We are to have a club
meeting at the Evanses this afternoon, or
I should not be in such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am in a hurry, too,&rdquo; said Miss
Newman, &ldquo;for I am very anxious to get
home to my sister. Thank you very
much for the umbrella. I should have
had to go in somewhere, it is pouring so,
and that would have delayed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Celia came up and Edna
slipped under her sister&rsquo;s umbrella.
They took their car at the next corner,
but they saw Miss Newman standing on
the other side waiting for the car which
should come along somewhat later.
&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said Edna as she looked
from the car window; &ldquo;she would have
been soaked, Celia, if she had had to
stand there without an umbrella, and she
has a cold now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia smiled. &ldquo;I believe you would
love a chimpanzee, or a snake, Edna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think little green snakes are very
pretty,&rdquo; returned Edna calmly. &ldquo;Cousin
Ben likes them, too. He showed me one
in the grass last Sunday. I felt sorry
for it because nearly everybody hates
snakes, and Cousin Ben said this one was
perfectly harmless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I draw the line at snakes,&rdquo; returned
Celia. &ldquo;I suppose you feel sorry for
Miss Newman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do; she is so unpretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia laughed. &ldquo;That is a delicate way
of putting it, I am sure. Well, I am glad
she has one friend; no doubt she needs it.
Most of the girls aren&rsquo;t so ready to say
nice things of her as they were of Miss
Ashurst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied Edna, &ldquo;and that
is one reason Dorothy and I stand up for
her. We say suppose we were as&mdash;as
ugly as that, and had to go a long, long
way to school every day to teach horrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
girls who didn&rsquo;t be nice to us, how would
we like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks like a cross old thing,&rdquo;
returned Celia rather flippantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t exactly cross, but she isn&rsquo;t
the kind you can lean up against and say
&lsquo;what a pretty tie you have on,&rsquo; as we did
with Miss Ashurst. Celia, I am afraid
Miss Newman never will get married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Celia laughed. &ldquo;Perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t
want to. Everyone doesn&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was rather beyond Edna&rsquo;s comprehension,
and she sat pondering over
the extraordinary statement till the car
reached the station. She arrived early
in the school-room on Monday morning to
find Miss Newman already there. She
looked up with a smile as the little girl
entered. &ldquo;I brought back your umbrella,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I
should have done without it. I left my
sister rather worse than usual and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
wanted very much to get home as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your sister ill?&rdquo; asked Edna</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is never very well. When she
was a little girl, younger than you, she fell
and hurt her spine. She has never been
well since, and at times suffers very
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was she this morning?&rdquo; asked
Edna sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was much better. I left her sitting
on the porch in the sun. She can
walk only a few steps, you see, and sometimes
has to be lifted from place to
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who lifts her?&rdquo; Edna was much
interested at this peep into Miss Newman&rsquo;s
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do when I am there, for I know just
how to do it without hurting her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she sit there all day where you
left her?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, for she has a wheeling chair
and the old woman who lives with us can
wheel her in when she is ready to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me some more.&rdquo; Edna leaned
her elbows on the table and looked at her
teacher with a wistful look. She did feel
so very sorry for this poor sister who
could not walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a very cheerful, bright person,&rdquo;
Miss Newman went on, &ldquo;and everyone
loves her. She is very fond of children
and is continually doing something for
those in the neighborhood. It is far from
being a wealthy street, and back of us
there are many very poor people. At
Christmas we had a tree for the ones who
couldn&rsquo;t have one at home, and my sister
made nearly everything on it, such pretty
things they were, too. There was a
present for each child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that was perfectly lovely,&rdquo;
said Edna. This was the kind of thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that appealed to her. &ldquo;What is your
sister&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her name is Eloise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that is a beautiful name. I
should like very much to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would like very much to see you,
for she knows every one of my class, and
asks about each one when I go home.
You see she cannot go out into the
world where I go, I have to take what I
can of it to her.&rdquo; It was evident that
this was the subject which was nearest to
the teacher&rsquo;s heart, and that when talking
of it she showed the gentlest side of her
nature. &ldquo;How would you like to go
home with me this afternoon to see her,
you and Dorothy Evans?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would love to go, but are you sure
she would like to have us come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of anything that would
please her more. She has never seen one
of my pupils and has often longed to, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
as I told you she has to see the world
through my eyes, and anything that interests
me interests her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Dorothy as soon as she comes
and I will ask Celia if I may go. Thank
you, Miss Newman for inviting us.&rdquo;
Then a number of girls came in and
school was called to order before Edna
had a chance to speak to her sister.</p>

<p>At recess, however, the matter was
talked over, both Agnes and Celia listening
attentively. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they
ought to go home with Miss Newman,&rdquo;
decided Agnes, &ldquo;for she probably has
dinner as soon as she gets home and it
would make extra trouble. If they could
go later it might be all right. I&rsquo;d better
go and talk to Miss Newman myself,
then we can tell better what can be done.&rdquo;
She went off and soon came back to say
that she had arranged to go with the little
girls later in the afternoon. &ldquo;We can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
take a car from there which will connect
with our line and in that way we shall not
have to come all the way back into the
city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a better arrangement than that was
made, for when Margaret and Jennie
heard of the affair they were so eager to
be included in the party, that Miss Newman
noticing their wistfulness, asked if
they, too, would come. &ldquo;There is nothing
my sister likes better than to have
a company of children around her to
whom she can tell some tale. She is a
great one for that, and often has as many
as a dozen children on the porch,&rdquo; she
told them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I will tell you what we can do,&rdquo;
said Jennie. &ldquo;I know mother will say
we may all go in the motor-car, and I can
take you girls home just as well as not.
I will call mother up now and tell her all
about it.&rdquo; So in a few minutes the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
matter was arranged by telephone. The
three little girls, Edna, Dorothy and Margaret
were to go home with Jennie to
luncheon and then they would make the
start from there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just like the Ramseys,&rdquo; said
Agnes, &ldquo;they always come forward at
just the right moment and do the thing
that makes it pleasantest all around.
Now we can go home at the usual time,
Celia feeling perfectly safe about the
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore about three o&rsquo;clock on this
bright afternoon in May they set forth
in the automobile which was to take them
to Miss Newman&rsquo;s and call for them later.
Through a very unfamiliar part of the
city they went till they came to a short
street with a row of small houses on each
side. Each house had a garden in front
and a porch. In the very last one which
had more ground around it than the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Miss Newman lived. The porch was
covered with vines and in the garden
there was a perfect wealth of flowers. A
bird-cage in which a canary was singing,
hung near the window. One end of the
porch was screened by a bamboo shade.
It was a very pretty nesty little place.
Huddled down in a chair, with her head
supported by pillows was Miss Eloise who
smiled up at the girls as Miss Newman
brought them forward one after another.
Miss Eloise had a much more lovely face
than her sister. Her eyes were beautiful,
she had quantities of wavy dark hair, a
sweet mouth and a delicate nose. The
hand she held out was so small and fragile
that when Edna clasped it in her plump
fingers it seemed almost as if she were
holding the claws of some bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this is Edna,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She
looks just as I thought she did. Dorothy
I know her by her hair, and Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
because she is the tallest of them, so of
course the one left must be Jennie. I am
so pleased to see you all. Sister, will you
wheel me just a little further back so
there will be more room for us all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Newman was quick to spring to
her sister&rsquo;s side, wheeling the chair at just
the right angle, settling the pillows, and
then passing her hand caressingly over
Miss Eloise&rsquo;s dark locks. The girls
could not imagine her so tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are feeling well to-day,&rdquo;
began Edna to start the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t feel well in such glorious
weather. It is such a beautiful
world, and has so many interesting things
in it. How is your sister, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very well,&rdquo; replied Edna, surprised
that Miss Eloise should know she
had a sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yours, Dorothy? I hear she is
such a sweet, pretty girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy likewise surprised, made
answer that Agnes was very well and
would have come with them but that the
four of them came in the Ramseys&rsquo; motor-car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t it fun to see it come whirling
up?&rdquo; said Miss Eloise. &ldquo;It was the
very first time a motor-car ever came to
our door, and I was excited over it. I
think it was very sweet of Mrs. Ramsey
to give me this pleasure, and, Margaret
I cannot tell you how I enjoyed the
flowers you used to bring to sister in the
winter. Your mother must have the loveliest
greenhouse. I never saw such fine
big stalks of mignonette. We shall have
mignonette a little later, for our flowers
are coming on finely. As for the books
you all gave sister at Christmas they have
been a perfect feast. I am so glad to
have you here and to be able to thank
you for all the things you have done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
make the long winter go more quickly for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls looked at one another. If
they had known what their little gifts
were to mean, how many times they
could have added to them. They had not
a word to say for they had not understood
how a little ripple of kindness may widen
till it touches an unknown shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me about your club,&rdquo; Miss
Eloise went on. &ldquo;I should so like to hear
what you did at the last meeting. Sister
tells me all she can, but she doesn&rsquo;t have
a chance to learn as much as I should
like. I am so greedy, you see. I am like
a child who says when you tell it a story,
and think you have finished, &lsquo;Tell on.&rsquo; I
am always crying &lsquo;Tell on.&rsquo; It is the
most beautiful club I ever heard of and I
am sorry I am not a little girl at your
school so I could belong to it and enjoy
the good times with you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, darling, you have your own little
club,&rdquo; said her sister, &ldquo;and you are always
thinking of what you can do for others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, but I live in such a tiny
little world, and my &lsquo;little drops of water,
little grains of sand&rsquo; are such wee
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They mean a great deal more than you
imagine,&rdquo; said her sister gently. &ldquo;I am
sure I could never live without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is because you make so much
of me and what I do. She is a great
sister,&rdquo; she said nodding to the girls.
&ldquo;She is a regular Atlas because she has
to bring her world home on her back every
day to me. Yes, indeed. Perhaps you
don&rsquo;t think I am aware of all that goes on
in that school-room. Why I even know
when one of you misses a lesson, and if
you will let me tell you a secret, I actually
cried the day Clara Adams did the caricature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, oh, dear,&rdquo; Edna could not
help sighing aloud while the other girls
looked as much ashamed as if they had
done the thing themselves. However,
when Miss Eloise saw this she broke into
a laugh and began to tell them of some
very funny thing she had seen from the
porch that morning, then followed one
funny tale after another till the girls
were all laughing till the tears ran down
their cheeks. Miss Eloise had the drollest
way of telling things, and the merriest
laugh herself. After a while Miss Newman
went inside and presently came out
with a tray on which were glasses of
lemonade and a plate of small cakes.
These were passed around, and much enjoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell them one of your stories,&rdquo;
said Miss Newman to her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I make up a new one or shall I
tell them one of the old ones?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them the one the Maginnis children
like so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children settled themselves in
pleased anticipation, and a marvelous
tale they listened to. Miss Eloise had a
wonderful gift of story-telling and made
every incident seem real and every character
to stand out as vividly as if he or
she were actually before them. The
children listened in wrapt attention. She
was a wonder to them.</p>

<p>The tale was scarcely over when up
came the motor-car with Mrs. Ramsey in
it. She stepped out and came in the gate
and up to the porch. &ldquo;I wanted to come,
too, Miss Newman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope
you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; cried Jennie, &ldquo;you are
just too late to hear the most beautiful
story ever was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now isn&rsquo;t that too bad?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ramsey. &ldquo;I feel guilty to interrupt this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
pleasant party, but I am afraid I shall
have to take these girls home for it is
getting late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, she did not hurry them and
there was time for her to have a little talk
with both Miss Newman and Miss Eloise.
Just as she was about to take her leave
she asked, &ldquo;Do you think you would be
able to take a little ride in the motor-car,
Miss Eloise, if I were to come for you
some day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sister, could I?&rdquo; Miss Eloise
turned to Miss Newman, her eyes like
stars. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been off this street for
years,&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Ramsey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would be very careful,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Ramsey, seeing that Miss Newman looked
doubtful. &ldquo;The man could wheel the
chair out to the car and could lift her in.
It runs very smoothly and we would not
go too fast nor on any of the streets which
are not asphalt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sister!&rdquo; Miss Eloise looked as
pleadingly as any child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never wheeled her further than
the corner,&rdquo; said Miss Newman, &ldquo;for fear
of the jolting when we had to go over the
curb, but some day when she is feeling her
best&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will let me know&mdash;&rdquo; put in Mrs.
Ramsey eagerly. &ldquo;Of course you will go,
too, Miss Newman, and as soon as you
think she has gone far enough we can
come back. You know it is quite smooth
and the riding easy going even as far as
Brookside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why that is our station,&rdquo; spoke up
Edna.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ramsey nodded and smiled, and
they said their good-bys leaving Miss
Eloise feeling as if a new world were to
open to her.</p>

<p>Of course Mrs. Ramsey listened to a
full account of all that had gone on dur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>ing
the afternoon, and was deeply interested
in the two sisters. &ldquo;I just love Miss
Newman,&rdquo; declared Dorothy. &ldquo;She is
the sweetest thing to her sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They just adore one another,&rdquo; Jennie
told her mother. &ldquo;Miss Newman seems
like some one else when I think of her
now. I am so glad we went.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; replied her mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Eloise knows all about our
club and is so interested in it,&rdquo; Edna
remarked. &ldquo;Girls, we must always tell
Miss Newman about the meetings after
this so she can tell Miss Eloise all that
goes on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we must,&rdquo; they agreed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know something better than that you
could do,&rdquo; Mrs. Ramsey told them.
&ldquo;Why not make Miss Eloise an honorary
member as you did Nettie Black? I think
you could stretch your rule far enough not
to make it out of the way to have one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
grown up person, when it is such a character
as Miss Eloise. She could be the
exception who will prove the rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Ramsey, she couldn&rsquo;t come
to the meetings.&rdquo; Dorothy reminded
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you could take turns in going
to her; I mean you could appoint a committee
of two to go to her each week and
tell her about the previous meeting, then
once in a while when she felt able, you
could meet at her house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a perfectly fine plan,&rdquo; cried
Edna. &ldquo;Will you tell Agnes and Celia
about it, Mrs. Ramsey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why certainly, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now? This afternoon when you take
us to our houses, Dorothy and me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any objection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The upshot of this was that Miss Eloise
was admitted to the club to her intense
delight. After Agnes and Celia had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
to see her they were so enthusiastic that
all the girls in the club by twos and threes
paid her visits, and she came to know
them every one.</p>

<p class="desc">THE FLOWER PLAY</p>


<p>As the time approached for the flower
play to be given attention there was considerable
anxiety on the part of those who
had taken it in hand. Ben declared that
while he could do the main part of the
work all right, he must have help of the
girls in certain directions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good
at all when it comes to dialogue,&rdquo; he told
them. &ldquo;I can do the mechanical part,
get the thing into shape for the stage, give
you the general plot and all that, but
you&rsquo;ll have to do the dialogue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Ben,&rdquo; said Agnes, &ldquo;suppose
we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it will have to fall through.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls looked very sober over this;
they realized that Ben was giving them
more than they had any right to expect,
and they could not ask him to give his
studies second place. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said
Agnes rather dolefully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to do
the best we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Angels can do no more,&rdquo; returned Ben,
&ldquo;and since you are so near to that class of
beings you ought to be able to do something
pretty fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The compliment had the effect of bringing
a smile to Agnes&rsquo;s face and so the
matter rested for that day. However, it
was a subject which could not be allowed
to rest for very long as the time was fast
approaching when the parts must be given
out for the girls to study. &ldquo;And there
will have to be ever so many rehearsals,&rdquo;
said Agnes woefully to Celia as they were
talking it over together on the Conways&rsquo;
porch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to make a bit of headway,&rdquo;
said Celia. &ldquo;What we have
written sounds so silly and flat. I&rsquo;m
afraid it will never be the kind of thing
we hoped for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben has a lovely little plot and all the
ideas he has given us about the scenes and
the dressing of the characters and the
funny situations are mighty good,&rdquo; returned
Agnes, &ldquo;it does seem as if between
us all we ought to be able to do the rest
when we have eighteen regular members
in the club and two honorary ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna who was sitting on the top step
listening attentively to all this, looked up.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask Miss Eloise to help
you? She would love to, and she tells
such beautiful, beautiful stories, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a brilliant idea,&rdquo; returned
Agnes, &ldquo;but she says she can never write
them, she can only tell them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t she tell what to say and
one of you write it down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Agnes looked at Celia and Celia looked
at Agnes. &ldquo;She has struck it, I do believe,&rdquo;
cried Celia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edna, honey, you are a child worth
knowing,&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;The idea of your
thinking of such a simple way out of the
trouble when the rest of us were fumbling
around for ideas. Of course that can be
done, and as you say, I have no doubt but
that Miss Eloise will be perfectly delighted
to do anything she can for the club.
Where is Ben? Do hunt him up, Edna,
that&rsquo;s a good child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Edna generally knew Ben&rsquo;s haunts
she was not long in finding him. He was
much interested in what she had to say,
threw down the book he was studying and
went with her to join the girls. He was
really very anxious to please them all and
would go to almost any lengths to do it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; cried Agnes as he came up on
the porch. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a fine scheme that
Edna has thought of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should smile, and I have thought of
just the stunt to get it in shape the quickest.
If one of you girls will go with me
to present me to the lady, I can take down
what she says in shorthand and knock it
off on the type-writer afterward. Then
we&rsquo;ll all get together, you two girls, Miss
Eloise and yours truly, and we&rsquo;ll put the
whole thing into shape in double-quick
time. How does that strike you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben, you have saved our lives. When
can you go to see Miss Eloise? This afternoon?
It is Saturday and you haven&rsquo;t
anything on hand more important than
foot-ball, have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not speak slightingly of my
athletic sports, if you please. However,
I can forego the delights of being mauled
for one afternoon, I reckon, and am at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
your service, fair lady. When shall you
want to start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, right after luncheon, I think; as
early as possible so as to have a good long
afternoon. I do hope Miss Eloise is feeling
fairly well to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="tn231" id="tn231"></a><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: missing opening bracket in the original text">&ldquo;Miss Newman</ins> says she is better all the
time nowadays, since she has so much
more to interest her,&rdquo; piped up Edna.
&ldquo;She told me yesterday that she had not
had one of those dreadful attacks for ever
so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let us hope for the best,&rdquo; answered
Ben.</p>

<p>It was exactly as Edna had predicted;
Miss Eloise entered into the plan with the
greatest eagerness, and when Ben had
opened up his plot to her and had showed
her how he had planned the scenes she
said she would take a few minutes to think
it over and then she thought she could
give him some of the needed dialogue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
before they left Ben had taken down as
much as was necessary for this first time,
promising to come back for the rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get this into shape and bring it
with me,&rdquo; he told Miss Eloise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we can make copies so as to give
out that much for the girls to learn,&rdquo; said
Agnes.</p>

<p>They returned in high spirits, and for
some time Ben&rsquo;s type-writing machine
was heard clicking away. The characters
had already been talked over and the
principle ones given out. Ben had
chosen very pretty fantastic names for
the various flowers who were to be represented.
Jennie was to be Pussy Willow;
Edna, Pinky Blooms; Dorothy, Daisy
White; Agnes, Rose Wild; Celia, Violet
Blue, while Ben, himself was to be the old
giant, Pine Knot, who lived in a swamp.
It had been found necessary to introduce
some of the boys into the play so Charlie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and Frank Conway, Steve and Roger
Porter were pressed into service. Charlie
was to be Sassy Fras; Frank,
Winter Green; Steve, Cran Berry, while
Roger was to be the giant&rsquo;s henchman,
Pine Needles.</p>

<p>The play was not to be for a week after
school closed that they all might have
plenty of time for its preparation without
interfering with their school work.
There was never very much fuss made
over the closing by Uncle Justus, so there
was not that excitement. Mr. Horner
did not believe in showy commencements,
and when the girls were graduated they
simply received their diplomas after a few
simple exercises, and then the school was
dismissed. Therefore, the play was the
great subject of conversation among the
scholars. The girls who were already in
the club were triumphantly sounding its
praises to those who were not, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
those who were not in were clamoring for
entrance. However, it had been decided
that no more new members would be admitted
until fall, as there was already
enough heart-burning over the players
and their parts. The giving out of these
had been left entirely to Miss Eloise who
had chosen as she thought best, so there
was at least no one of the girls to accuse of
partiality. Margaret in the very beginning
announced that her mother did not
want her to take part and that she did
not care to herself, as she was to have the
fun of entertaining them all at her house,
and moreover, she &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t act any more
than a broomstick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of all the girls who felt the most bitter
probably Clara Adams was the one who
was chief among them. It was the greatest
grievance she had ever known, in the
first place not to take part in such a thing
and in the second not even to be invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to the entertainment. Each girl in the
club was allowed to ask two persons, and
each one taking part in the play was allowed
the same privilege, therefore, with
her two brothers among the characters
and her sister as well, Edna was free to ask
anyone she chose. Mr. and Mrs. Horner
had received an invitation from the whole
club, so had Miss Newman, and the other
teachers, and many of the pupils who
were outside the charmed circle were invited
by their schoolmates who were free
to give invitations, only Clara Adams was
not considered for a moment by anyone,
and she was very miserable over the fact.
If ever she regretted her past disagreeable
treatment of her school fellows, it
was now, but she would not have admitted
this even to herself, although in her heart
of hearts she was conscious of it being
so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming back here to school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
next year,&rdquo; she announced to Edna one
day. The two had little chats once in
a while and, to do Clara justice, she did
her best to be pleasant whenever Edna
gave her the chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you? Why not?&rdquo; asked
Edna.</p>

<p>Clara was silent for a moment, then
she said, quite honestly, &ldquo;My father can&rsquo;t
afford to send me to such an expensive
school. I suppose I shall have to go to
the public school.&rdquo; Then in a new accession
of pride, &ldquo;Anyhow, father likes the
public school better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Edna could not truthfully say
she was sorry, for the fact, though she
was sorry for the girl. She told the other
girls what Clara had said and the gist of
most of the responses was &ldquo;Good riddance
to bad rubbish.&rdquo; So it did not
look very favorable for an enthusiastic
farewell to poor Clara in the way of at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>tentions
to a departing friend. If anyone
thought of her at all it was Edna, and
she was too busy with all her other interests
to give much regret to Clara.</p>

<p>It was only when her mother asked her
one day, &ldquo;Has anyone invited Clara
Adams to the great meeting of the club
when you are to wind up the year with
such a flourish?&rdquo; that her conscience began
to prick her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody has asked her,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;and she is dying to come. She isn&rsquo;t
coming back to school next year, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you told me that. I feel
very sorry for her. Of course, she is not
at all the kind of child I should choose
for a companion for my little girl, but I
am very glad you have tried to be kind to
her, though I cannot say I regret her leaving
the school you attend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna was silent for a moment and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was her mother who presently asked:
&ldquo;Have you given out all your invitations,
dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, mother, I still have one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom did you send the other to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Martin. She and her father
were so nice to me at the fair you know,
but one of the other girls has invited Mr.
Martin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. That was certainly a very
good choice for you to make.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite decide about the other
one,&rdquo; Edna went on. &ldquo;I want to give it
to the one who wants it most, of the two
girls at school who would love to have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is one of them Clara Adams?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, no. Nobody wants her.&rdquo;
Then after a silence, &ldquo;I suppose she
wants to come badder than anyone else,
but&mdash;mother, do you think, do you really
think I ought to invite her?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, that is for you to
decide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; Edna gave a long sigh.
Never in her life had she been more put
to it to make up her mind. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to one bit,&rdquo; she declared after a
moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;All of the girls will
be down on me and say I am a silly goose
and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is probably your very last chance
of doing her a kindness as she will possibly
not cross your path again,&rdquo; Mrs.
Conway reminded her.</p>

<p>Edna drew a longer sigh than before.
The situation was getting harder and
harder. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said with a woebegone
face, &ldquo;why do the rightest things
always be the hardest ones?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they always are, dear
child. Is this so very hard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I think it is the hardest
thing I most ever had to do. Even last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
year when those things about Louis worried
me so, I didn&rsquo;t mind so much, for I
was really fond of Louis. He was my
cousin and it seemed more as if I ought
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dearie, suppose you think over
it a while. You can keep back your invitation
till the very last minute, you know,
for if you do decide to let Clara have it,
she will be glad to accept even at the
eleventh hour, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose she should say horrid mean
things and stir up a fuss as she does so
many times, I should feel so badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she would do that because
she would be enjoying herself and
would probably be on her best behavior.
If you like, I will see that she sits next
to me which would be quite right if she
should be your guest, and it will not spoil
my pleasure if she should make disagreeable
remarks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna went over and leaned her elbows
on her mother&rsquo;s lap, looking up in her
face and asking. &ldquo;What would you say
to yourself if she made disagreeable remarks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say, &lsquo;Never mind; I am so
happy that my own darling little girl
made the sacrifice of asking her that nothing
else matters much.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should, no doubt, say several things
to her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Conway kissing the
eager face uplifted toward hers.</p>

<p>Edna went over to the window and
stood there a long time, but she saw none
of the things she looked out upon. She
was having a sharp struggle. Clara and
her mother against all the girls in the
club, that was the way it seemed to be,
but finally the former conquered and she
went back to where her mother still sat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said firmly, &ldquo;I am going
to invite Clara. I have made up my
mind. Will you please ask Agnes and
Celia to take my part?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My blessed child, of course I will.
What sort of a Golden Rule would it be
that allowed a little girl to be chidden for
carrying out its precepts. <a name="tn242" id="tn242"></a><ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original has 'As president, of your club'">As president
of your club</ins>, Agnes will surely see that
you are acting upon its principles, and
Celia, too, must see it. They must not
let their enjoyment and their love of
harmony make them forget that part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Edna snuggled very close to her
mother and felt comforted. &ldquo;I am not
going to keep her from knowing,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her first thing, so she can
have the fun of looking forward to it.&rdquo;
When Edna did a thing there was no
doing it by halves.</p>

<p>Therefore it was a surprised and delighted
Clara who received her invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the next day, and to Edna&rsquo;s great satisfaction
all the good in the girl rose to the
occasion. &ldquo;I think you are the very
sweetest girl I ever knew, Edna Conway,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I am sorry, I really am,
that I haven&rsquo;t always been friends with
you. I was horrid, often I was,&rdquo; and this
was Edna&rsquo;s compensation.</p>

<p>Such a flutter and flurry and whispering
and giggling there was on that afternoon
when everything was in readiness for the
little flower play. There was quite a large
audience gathered on the smooth green
lawn where seats had been placed for
them. The shrubs and flower beds with
trees beyond made a fine background for
the stretch of terrace, which became a
stage for the occasion. Jennie in a fuzzy
grayish brown frock with a hood, made
a dear little Pussy Willow, Edna in pink
with her rosy cheeks was the very picture
of Pinky Blooms, Dorothy&rsquo;s golden head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
made a lovely centre for Daisy White,
while as for Ben, the big giant, he was the
roughest, toughest old Pine Knot one
could imagine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only Miss Eloise could be here to
see us,&rdquo; said Edna as she peeped from
behind the leafy screen which hid the
flower fairies from view.</p>

<p>Dorothy was peeping, too, and presently
she exclaimed, &ldquo;She is here! Oh,
Edna, she is here! See, they are bringing
her now!&rdquo; And sure enough, there
in her wheeled chair was Miss Eloise, her
lovely face all smiles as her sister and
Mr. Ramsey pushed her chair along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do believe Mrs. Ramsey brought her
out,&rdquo; cried Edna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did,&rdquo; Jennie told them, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
tell, because I thought it would be such
a nice surprise for everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A surprise it was indeed, and because
of her presence, or because it is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
so, they all did much better than at any
of their rehearsals and received such applause
as quite overpowered them. Then
Mr. Ramsey raised a call for &ldquo;Author!
Author!&rdquo; So after some little delay
Ben, still in his giant&rsquo;s dress, was brought
around and wheeled Miss Eloise out to
the very front where she was given
another round of applause and more
flowers than she could hold. She quite
forgot herself in her anxiety that Ben
should receive what was due to him and all
unmindful of the large audience, she
cried out, &ldquo;Oh, but I did so little; it is
all Ben&rsquo;s plan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Ben was cheered, and in the midst
of such very special demonstrations he
beat a retreat.</p>

<p>Clara established by Mrs. Conway&rsquo;s
side had not a word of anything but
praise and delight, and after the little
players came out to mix with their friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
she sought out Edna. &ldquo;It was the loveliest
thing I ever saw,&rdquo; she told her, &ldquo;and
I do thank you for letting me come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was really very decent,&rdquo; said the
girls, looking after her as she started for
home with her mother who called for her.</p>

<p>Edna watched her out of sight, a feeling
of pity mingled with gladness in her
heart. And so Clara Adams passed out
of her life, for before another year the
entire family had moved out west, and
the places which saw Clara Adams saw
her no more.</p>

<p>The stars were coming out before they
all left Mrs. MacDonald&rsquo;s. The guests
had taken their departure earlier and had
been as complimentary as anyone could
desire. Miss Eloise, tired but very
happy, had gone off with the Ramseys
in their motor-car. Edna, Dorothy and
Margaret walked down to the gate to
watch the sunset, all yellow and glowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Newman looked almost pretty,&rdquo;
said Dorothy. &ldquo;She had such a dear
frock on and her hair is much nicer the
way she wore it to-day. I shall feel so
very different about having her for a
teacher next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So shall I,&rdquo; agreed Edna.</p>

<p>Moggins, Margaret&rsquo;s cat had sought
them out and was rubbing up against his
little mistress. &ldquo;Oh, you poor dear, I
don&rsquo;t believe anyone has thought to give
you your milk,&rdquo; said Margaret. So she
went off with the cat in her arms.</p>

<p>Then &ldquo;Where are you, Dorothy?&rdquo;
cried her sister, and Dorothy scampered
off that she might not be left behind on
the homeward walk.</p>

<p>Edna walked slowly toward the house.
Halfway up the walk she met Uncle Justus.
&ldquo;I was just coming for you to walk
home with me,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;Your aunt
and I are going to stay all night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; Edna replied slipping
her hand into his.</p>

<p>They walked on toward the road, quite
silent for a few moments, till Edna looking
up, said, &ldquo;Uncle Justus, I think you
have a perfectly lovely school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some perfectly lovely pupils,&rdquo;
he answered with a smile.</p>
